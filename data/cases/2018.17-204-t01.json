Was it about a vertical supply chain or, instead, was it about a pass-through theory? Now, in the facts of Illinois Brick and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois Brick cases that we've discussed, you had both. So you didn't have to separate the two. And now, here, you don't have both, because this is not a vertical supply chain, but there still is a pass-through mechanism. So then the question is, does Illinois Brick apply to that or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting to you, that as long as it's not that vertical supply chain where the person is not buying from the monopolist itself, here, the person is transacting with the monopolist itself, that that's what separates this case from Illinois Brick and makes it entirely different, notwithstanding that there's some kind of pass-through mechanism involved."
