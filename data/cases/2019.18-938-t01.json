And, therefore, it does change a lot. And it does move the case forward by denying their relief from stay so that the parties can adjudicate it in bankruptcy court.

And that's simply because upon plan confirmation and discharge occurs, there is no stay in place and, therefore, any party who tries to appeal the -- the denial, it's immediately moot and it's going to be dismissed. So I would say that, to answer the first question, is that there might be more appeals during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, but those would be meaningful appeals. And creditors need to have the ability to have meaningful appeal, not one that gets mooted. The second issue that I have with Ritzen's position and that responds to Your Honor's question is that we have to presume that actors -- that creditors are going to act in their own economic interest in connection with a bankruptcy case. In a case like this, where the bankruptcy court is saying that we're going to adjudicate it through a truncated summary claims adjudication procedure, that a creditor is not going to spend a lot of time and a lot of money on an appeal process just to get to an even lengthier and more expensive state court when it could be resolved. Debtor side lawyers, we're not afraid of appeals during bankruptcy case."
