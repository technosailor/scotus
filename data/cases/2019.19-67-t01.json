And in 8 U.S.C. 1621, the Immigration and Nationality Act expressly contemplates that there are going to be circumstances in which public and private benefits may be given to people who are in the United States unlawfully. The statute has never been used, to my knowledge, and Respondent and her amici have not come up with an instance where it's been used, to prosecute conduct of the type that you're hypothesizing, Justice Kavanaugh."

I'll point out the second problem with constitutional avoidance is the discussion that we've been having this morning, which is it doesn't actually avoid the problem because, if all you're doing is change the verb from encourage and induce to solicit, you are simply creating a brand-new First Amendment exclusion by creating a statute that prohibits encouraging or soliciting non-criminal conduct, which we've never seen a single statute like that before --"

Congress was using these words in their normal criminal law meaning because let's not forget, this statute, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Breyer, covers the facilitation, solicitation of a lot of actual criminal conduct, coming to and entering the United States unlawfully. To the extent that it also covers certain civil violations, for reasons I've discussed, I think this Court has recognized in previous cases like Pittsburgh Press and Gazzam and in the white-applicants-only example that Congress or another legislature can civilly proscribe speech that facilitates activities that are civilly prohibited. And if Congress -- and if that were really protected speech, Congress or another legislature couldn't even civilly proscribe it. The reason why it can be civilly proscribed is because it is unprotected speech. And if it's unprotected speech, then it can be subject to a criminal prohibition as well. This -- to the extent that this statute may reach some protected speech, it can be handled as applied."
