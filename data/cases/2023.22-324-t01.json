But, for most of the hypotheticals I think you were asking me in the line of questions you were about to ask, yes, if you're telling people things about the rules of the road of the government, things that as a governmental matter you have a duty to disclose because you can't just spring rules on people or tell people -- not tell people things they need to know in their official capacity, then, if that's the only place you announce that, is your government account, then I assume that that's likely going to be a very strong indicia that you're using the account for government purposes."

The reason why I think it's important to think about this at the account level is there's a lot of speech that might be -- speech that might be viewed as official but isn't an official duty to provide information to people in, like, the hypotheticals Justice Kavanaugh was asking me. And so a way of differentiating the two, announcing, for example, that I'm going to sign a bill, announcing I'm going to appoint a judge, those sort of things are things you could do in a -- even if you view those as official in some sense, that doesn't mean that you're using the property where you make that speech in an official capacity."

So I think the presumptions and the rules of thumb and the like operate a little bit differently here than they would operate in a case that involved someone who was clearly just a private actor and you're asking, can you push them over the line into being a state actor?
