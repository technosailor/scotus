It would make no sense at all for Congress to treat workers who had the same ability to disrupt commerce differently simply because of what their contract said.

And, second, if a contract misclassified a worker, illegally misclassified a worker as an independent contractor, then the FAA, unlike any other federal statute, would depend on that illegal misclassification, rather than the actual worker's status. And so we have the text of the statute, the context of the statute, and the absurd results that would result, all leading us, pointing us in the same direction.
