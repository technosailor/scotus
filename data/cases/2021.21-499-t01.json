And the Chavez plurality, I think, addresses this issue head on, and it says that because Miranda's a judicially created prophylactic rule, the violation of that rule doesn't violate anyone's constitutional rights. And that's consistent, as I was saying earlier, with what the Court had previously said in cases like Payne and Elstad."

And I think it's very similar to the direct appeal context, and I think it's consistent with the underlying purposes of Miranda and Dickerson, which basically limit the presumption of coercion to the admissibility decision by the trial judge at the criminal trial. And I think Withrow says, essentially, recognizing that -- that that's where liberty matters most, we're going to apply the presumption of coercion in that circumstance and we're -- we're going to allow habeas relief. The text of the -- of the habeas statute is different from the text of 1983."

So there was inherent tension in Dickerson, and Chief Justice Rehnquist said we're not overruling Miranda and we're living with that tension but never characterized it as a right."

And so whether it's Patane saying -- the Patane plurality saying that there needs to be a close as possible fit between the -- the -- the application of the Miranda rule and the underlying right against compelled discrim- -- incrimination -- self-incrimination at trial or Tucker saying the same thing, you really need to do a very rigorous cost/benefit analysis and show that expand -- expanding or creating a prophylactic rule is really necessary. Here, we think it's necessary or the Court has said it's necessary when you're introducing evidence in the prosecution's case-in-chief at trial, but the Court has repeatedly refused to go beyond that, and we respectfully would submit that you shouldn't go beyond it in this case."

In addition, the Court sometimes adopts categorical rules that may fit imperfectly in some extreme cases, but it acknowledges that those cases are so unlikely to arise that it's not worth trying to deal with them. And the two best examples I can think of are the retaliatory inducement to prosecute case, Hartman against Moore, and Nieves against Bartlett, which is retaliatory arrest. In both of those cases, the Court said that because of causation problems, we're going to adopt a categorical rule requiring the plaintiff to show the absence of proximate -- of probable cause in order to allow that case to come forward. Now it's true, theoretically, you can think of some outlandish hypotheticals where there is probable cause, yet there should be a retaliatory arrest or prosecution claim, and the Court still said, we -- we're going to adopt a categorical rule. And we suggest that the Court could adopt a similar categorical rule here because, as you say, the only circumstances that we can think of where there's no causation problem are so outlandish, it's not worth trying to preserve those."

I think there's also issues relating to -- I mean, the -- Heck versus Humphrey will make these kind of cases, you know, less numerous because, if you are convicted, then you have to go through the whole appellate process. Qualified immunity may apply in some circumstances to limit the circumstances in which officers can be found liable. If officers come forward, as they should do, to give an honest and complete account of their -- the circumstances of an interrogation and the prosecutor decides to go forward and the error is in the court accepting something that it shouldn't have accepted, I don't think the officer is responsible there. So we're not saying that. You know, our -- our position is that, at least in the context of this case, there's a stark choice between a -- a deputy who, from our standpoint, told a completely false story to get this statement in versus our client, who tells a completely different story supported by co-workers, you know, to also contradict the -- the officer.
