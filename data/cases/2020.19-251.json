  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The California Attorney General\u2019s office has a policy requiring charities to provide the state, on a confidential basis, information about their major donors, purportedly to help the state protect consumers from fraud and the misuse of their charitable contributions. Petitioner Americans for Prosperity (and the petitioner in the consolidated case, Thomas More Law Center) either failed to file or filed redacted lists of their major donors with the California Attorney General\u2019s office, despite filing complete lists with the federal Internal Revenue Service, as required by federal law.</p>\n<p>In response to demands by the California Attorney General that they file the lists, the organizations filed a lawsuit alleging that the filing requirement unconstitutionally burdened their First Amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from financially supporting them. The organizations provided evidence that although the state is required to keep donor names private, the state\u2019s database was vulnerable to hacking, and many donor names were repeatedly released to the public. Based in part on this finding, the district court granted both organizations\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction and then ultimately found for them after a trial, holding that the organizations and their donors were entitled to First Amendment protection under the principles established in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in NAACP v. Alabama. In so holding, the court reasoned that the government\u2019s filing demands were not the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of obtaining the information and thus did not satisfy \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, based on its conclusion that \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d rather than \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d was the appropriate standard, and \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d requires that the government show that the disclosure and reporting requirements are justified by a compelling government interest and that the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit denied the petition for a rehearing en banc.</p>\n",
