The government's new patchwork test is little better than Hardison's."

And the Court ultimately resolved that issue by saying the 1972 statute and its undue hardship standard carries the same meaning as the predecessor version as interpreted in the light of that EEOC guidance. So it was essential to the Court's decision that it didn't have to resolve retroactivity, that it determined that the 1972 undue hardship standard had the same meaning as the standard it was applying in Hardison itself. And maybe another way to put this is to say that if there was any possibility of daylight with the 1972 statute having a -- a higher burden on employers, a different undue hardship standard, then the Court would have had to resolve that issue."

And if you are looking for more information to try to get a handle on the -- the wealth of case law out there applying Hardison, I'd urge the Court to consult the EEOC's compliance manual. We cite the manual throughout our brief, and it provides, I think, an excellent overview of the types of accommodation claims that come up again and again and the types of lines that courts have drawn through this context-based approach, taking account of Hardison's facts.

Just on the practical point, it's not possible to pick up and uproot the ADA case law and -- and transplant it in full to this new context, and the reason for that is because there are signals in the ADA itself that Congress had in mind very different potential types of accommodations, things like having to modify your existing facilities and undergo costly renovations to make them accessible to those with disabilities or -- or hire an entire additional employee to function as a sign language interpreter. And I don't think it would be reasonable, given the differences in the statutory structure, to say, well, that's not available in Title VII, but we're still going to say that the ADA case law carries its full meaning. Instead, what you'd have to do is start over, and you could use significant difficulty and expense, but at that point, you recognize that there's daylight between the statutes and it's a content-less standard. You're still going to have to engage in all of the hard work of deriving meaning by applying the standard to repeat fact patterns. That's the work that's already been done under Hardison in a way that we think is very much protecting religious exercise in the workplace, so I don't think it makes sense to start over under the ADA's standard."

And I acknowledge maybe there could be hard questions in this context-dependent analysis in the future about whether a $1 bump-up in salary should be considered premium.

The EEOC and the lower courts from 1980 onwards for more than 40 years have properly applied Hardison in light of its facts. And to Justice Gorsuch's point, to the extent any courts out there are reading this literally to mean de minimis means you never have to accommodate, that is wrong, that is inconsistent with the current state of the law, and the Court makes clear that's not what Hardison meant. And then I think, you know, to fill in the details, Justice Kavanaugh, I don't think there's a way for this Court to try to top-down do that with the limits of language that exist in this context's space. Instead, I think the way to preserve stability is to make clear that you don't need to redo all of the work that's been done for five decades under the Hardison standard as properly understood."

And so I think the right way to think about it is Congress struck the balance, it recognized that it is important to protect religious practice and liberty in the workplace, it created this duty to accommodate, but up to the line of undue hardship, and then to figure out what's undue, you look only at the employer side of things to figure out when the costs become inappropriate or unwarranted."

So the question before the Court is then, which new test is going to be applied? I wish I could agree with the government's rosy view of how lower courts have applied Hardison. A lot of that view seems to be coming from the EEOC, but it's quite notable that the EEOC has not joined this brief, as it has in many other civil rights cases. This Court should reject the government's watered-down test for undue hardship."
