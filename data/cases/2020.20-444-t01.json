The Fourth Circuit's per se rule would thus only serve to undermine the careful balance between judicial efficiency and fairness established by the Federal Rules and to provide a windfall to defendants like Respondent, whose convictions were and remain fundamentally fair. The Court should reverse the decision below, hold that forfeited Rehaif plea colloquy claims are subject to the same case-specific plain-error review as any other forfeited claim, and make clear that Respondent cannot make that showing. I welcome the Court's questions."

And that may sound like a formalistic rule, but, remember, guilty pleas are themselves an innovation the framers were not even aware of, and so, when you're going to introduce something -- a conviction without trial, the defendant should at least have fair notice."

If you're going to hold defendants to require them to object in all of those circumstances, the defenders tell you in the amicus brief and the judges themselves, district judges tell you themselves in their brief, what you're going to be requiring is an omnibus motion at the beginning of every criminal case and objections throughout that are all based on perhaps single judge opinions or single justice dissents that are just going to clog up the machinery of criminal justice.

On structural error, it's not clear, as Justice Kagan pointed out, why a mens rea element like this one would be more important to a defendant than the right at issue in Vonn, which was the right to counsel at trial, or the -- the -- the error in -- in Dominguez Benitez, which was informing the -- the district -- the defendant that he didn't -- he couldn't withdraw his plea if the Court didn't agree with the government's recommendation for a safety valve, which made the difference between a mandatory minimum of 10 years or only 70 months, could be only 70 months in prison.
