It's because, in 2008, at the time, there's these high throughput machines with wells of 384, and the testimony is that the robotics do it very rapidly and very quickly, thousands of wells, hundreds of plates, in a very short period of time. So, if someone's going to say it's undue experimentation to take these 3,000 antibodies that the mice produce, these humanized mice produce, and put it in a machine and wait for it to -- at a cost of $30, that's undue experimentation, that is very odd."

And I'm just concerned because there are going to be some areas, and perhaps this is one of them, where there's a reasonable degree of unpredictability in terms of the outcome, but you're sort of in the ballpark enough that we would want to make sure that there was innovation in this area with -- with these kinds of companies investing in -- in patenting these kinds of developments."

And Amgen says we can't use the doctrine of equivalents here, and the reason is because they're not equivalent, and because they're not equivalent, you have to enable all of the different antibodies.

But Professor Lemley has a new article from 2023, Yale Law Journal, which is called \"The Antibody Patent Paradox.\" And in that, he says, you know, it doesn't look like these antibody patents -- it doesn't look like these genus patents are enabled, but there is this doctrine of equivalents, and maybe it would take care of all of these innovation problems. And I think, honestly, even if you look at Footnote 399 of that original Lemley article, \"The Death of the Patent Genus,\" in that footnote, it says, now there is a case happening right now, it's -- it's Amgen versus Sanofi, and it doesn't really seem like that genus is enabled, but, you know, it's not enabled for a different reason.

I think it is correct this is an undue experimentation question, and we're going to say, like, is this something that a person skilled in the art is going to be willing to do? And, quite honestly, at the time of Wands, I think that people were a lot more comfortable doing the mouse inoculation process, and the reason for that -- and I hate to bring in yet another complicated area of science -- but recombinant DNA technology was in its infancy.
