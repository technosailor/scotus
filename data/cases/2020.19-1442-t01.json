And I think that's something that just goes to show there are a lot of guardrails already built into the nature of the Social Security judicial review scheme that ensure that courts are not going to be inundated with any sort of technical questions that are beyond their ken that the agency needed to weigh in on first. And other guardrails include things like the 405(g) textual standard that prohibits in general claimants from raising new evidence in court for the first time, the substantial evidence standard under which courts affirm the ALJ if there's more than a mere scintilla of evidence supporting the ALJ's determination, and then also, in addition to the regulation I cited requiring claimants to actually identify their disability, courts can, of course, remand if the agency requests a remand so that the agency could consider those technical questions if there was some sort of issue. And that, again, I think, reflects the current practice as well."

First, taking the nature of a Social Security proceeding, I do think Sims actually resolved a lot of the concerns with respect to whether courts are going to be facing sort of new evidence, new arguments, and have problems with them because most errors that are being raised in court are things that arose in the -- in the ALJ decision. Sims already held that you don't need to raise those issues to the Appeals Council. And so lots of questions, like whether a consultative expert should have been called or how the ALJ conducted questioning, are already in district court for the first time, and there is -- doesn't seem to be any problem, and the agency hasn't created a rule since Sims suggesting there isn't a problem. With respect to the futility issue, I don't take the government to be suggesting at any point in time that the agency would have ever been competent to adjudicate Appointments Clause challenges. Now they made that collusive in January 2018 when they told ALJs specifically to say they had no power to entertain such claims, but I don't think that was in question before then, and cases like Free Enterprise, as well as Eldridge and Califano in the Social Security context, underscore that such constitutional questions seem well beyond the agency's competence to adjudicate."

And I don't think there's any plausible claim here, given the regulations I've cited and given other aspects of the proceeding, that the agency has misled claimants, so the non-adversarial aspect of the proceedings would not alone be enough. And I just want to note that L.A. Tucker, of course, is not the only basis on which this Court could rule in our favor, as Ryder and Lucia and the de facto officer doctrine are an analytically independent basis for ruling for the government, and the rule in those cases doesn't depend on the non-adversarial quality of the agency proceedings."

We're not attempting -- we're not trying to downplay the significance of the Appointments Clause, but I think the remedy for an Appointments Clause violation has to be understood against the history of remedies. And traditional de facto doctrine, the only way to obtain a remedy for this kind of alleged harm was through a writ of quo warranto where the part -- where the officer was a direct party in the suit, and another party could obtain prospective relief. Now I think the courts eventually decided in the theories of cases in the late 20th century, culminating in Ryder, that that rule was a little too strict and it loosened it, and it adopted a rule that as long as you raise your argument before the adjudicator before he acts on your case, then that's reserved the argument and you can obtain relief on direct review."

First of all, the government's explanation for why the Social Security Administration has not adopted an issue exhaustion rule does not make a ton of sense. The idea that the agency has not been operating against the backdrop of Sims but is instead relying on five court of appeals that have purported to -- to require at least issue exhaustion for some people doesn't quite work out. The circuits are either not acknowledging Sims and, therefore, requiring exhaustion of issues that Sims itself would cover because they are errors that arose only in the ALJ decisions, or they're really explainable by a refusal to allow new evidence in proceedings, which is already covered by a lot of different provisions of the Social Security Act. And so it's pretty curious that if the agency were, in fact, operating under the assumption that issue exhaustion were -- was, in fact, the rule of the road for ALJ proceedings, why would ALJs ask for an issue exhaustion rule and why would the agency never tell claimants about such a rule if -- if that is, in fact, the reality on the ground? The government points to purported change costs of not adopting a rule."
