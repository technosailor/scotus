My practical understanding is that attempted service by mail to the embassies -- to United States embassies abroad happens nearly every day, and so that is actually a very large concern for us as a practical matter, whereas attempted service by mail to the State Department is actually much less frequent, just on the practicalities. As a legal matter, obviously, we think that the United States has a reciprocity interest in having foreign litigants or foreign sovereigns brought into our courts only under the same circumstances that we ask abroad. I don't think that there's a way to -- to read (b)(3) that doesn't permit service by mail to the foreign state, but -- to the foreign ministry in the foreign state, and so I think our reciprocity interests really come in where we think the text is clear under (a)(3) that you can't serve on an embassy, but -- but if, you know, there's any ambiguity there, that's where we think our reciprocity interests should be brought to bear. I would note more generally I think the United States' interests here are not only in reciprocity; they're also in consistency and predictability, which is something that this Court noted in Helmerich is especially important in the context of foreign sovereign immunity because we are bringing foreign sovereigns into our courts."

If you take a look at the critical piece of drafting history, the 1958 revised commentary, which really is the definitive commentary of the International Law Committee on the Vienna Convention, in the paragraph on which we rely, the very paragraph, they draw precisely this distinction. And the reason I would submit that they draw this distinction -- and this is also captured in Lord Sumption's opinion for the U.K. Supreme Court in Reyes -- is that there is something relating to dignitary interests about personal service, the notion that some person is going to turn up at the embassy or skulk around at the embassy and wait for someone to arrive so that they can hand them a document. That interferes with the functions of the embassy in a way that a mailing does not."

And I would urge this Court to take a look at the policy of the United States, which we cite in our brief and we provide a correct website in our supplemental letter, it's a very brief document, which makes clear that not only does the United States not accept service at its embassies; it would not accept mail service even at the State Department. The sole ways in which the United States accepts service, if you look at page 2 of the current version of the policy, is either through diplomatic channels or through the Hague service convention, which is what (a)(2) refers to. All we are saying is that if this Court gives full effect to the language of subsection (a)(3), a country can adopt such a policy and implement such a policy."
