If so, how could a provision that allows for removal for insubordination prevent the President from faithfully executing the law? Likewise, just how relaxed is standing in these cases? And, you know, more than that, how far is the Court really willing to go without clear constitutional text to guide it? These are all hard questions that have significance far beyond this appeal.
