In other words, whether or not the bankruptcy court can reach beyond the bankruptcy to bind people who are neither creditors nor debtors in the bankruptcy on the basis of not only sort of -- you know, it's (b)(6), after -- (1) through (5) are fairly focused, and this one's sort of a general catchall, which others are trying to seek broad authority.

I'd like to begin with three points. First, the Trustee's position is irreconcilable with the plain text of Section 1123(b)(6). Congress's use of \"any\" and \"appropriate,\" terms of breadth and flexibility, refute the Trustee's position that third-party releases are never authorized in any circumstances. Second, this case illustrates how third-party releases can and do directly advance the core objectives of bankruptcy in appropriate and appropriately limited circumstances. Because of the inextricable relationship between Purdue and the Sackler directors and officers of Purdue, victims have filed identical claims against Purdue and the Sacklers for the same injuries based on the same conduct. Everyone agrees that the claims against Purdue can be channeled to the creditor trusts."

And I'm curious why in this case that those principles which go way back in -- in this Court's jurisprudence as I see it wouldn't apply here and say, yeah, \"appropriate's\" a broad term, but we should read it narrowly because that would be a question of great economic significance that we won't assume Congress lightly assigned."

And then it said in a separate act of Congress, hey, don't infer from this special scheme that the authority didn't already exist. And I think that that one-two punch makes it all the more important for this Court not to take that away from Congress. If Congress wants to establish a more reticulated set of rules for this, it can, but this Court shouldn't say, as Congress didn't in 1994, that the authority doesn't exist at all given the plain text of 1123(b)(6)."

Indeed, it was the creditors that insisted on the release of the creditor claims against the Sacklers for the same injuries to avoid a value-destroying victim-against-victim race to the courthouse that would result in no recovery for virtually all except the United States. That unrebutted finding grounded in a massive record built on years of creditor victim-led efforts refutes the Trustee's eleventh-hour speculation of some magic alternative permitting an equitable victim recovery. That is why the fact-finder relied on Section 1123(b)(6)'s broad terms to approve the tailored release as essential to restructuring the debtor-creditor relationship in this case on which lives literally depend. I welcome the Court's questions."

So just to recap so far, we have no settlement, we have a Chapter 7 liquidation in which the U -- U.S.'s $2 billion priority claim eats up all assets, zero dollars for victims. You have their estate claims being litigated by a Chapter 7 liquidation trustee who has no assets to litigate them against plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing the Sacklers on all the creditor direct claims. Point number four: If even one of those direct claims, creditor claims, gets to judgment, that could wipe out all of the collectible Sackler assets."
