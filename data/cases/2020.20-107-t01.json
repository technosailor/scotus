First, the appropriation of a real property interest triggers a categorical duty to compensate."

As -- as the Court is aware, every takings claim begins with what is the property right that the private property owner possesses, and that looks to background principles of property law to determine what the scope of the property right is. With respect to the government's authority to search, that was certainly present at common law, and the Fourth Amendment put limits on the government's power -- power to search, but it certainly recognizes that that is a power that the government possessed at all times and certainly at the time of the California founding. So, when the government exercises that power to search, as it does with administrative search inspections and other -- other -- other searches, it is not taking away a property right from you because that's nothing that you possessed. As this Court said in Hurtado, the government doesn't have to pay for a duty that it is already owed."

It seems to me our precedent in the labor organizing context has drawn the lines and has established a very narrow and very simple resolution for this case, and I want you to tell me why it's wrong or why you disagree with it. Babcock was obviously a statutory case but informed by the Constitution explicitly, as I read it, and the question was how much access will we allow to property under the statute, the NLRA, given the constitutional backdrop of property rights? And the decision seems to reflect the Court's understanding of the Constitution and how much protection there is for property rights, at page 112 of the decision, and basically says no access unless you can show that there are no alternative means of communication that exist, to simplify what it says there. Doesn't Babcock reflect a constitutional line-drawing that controls this case?"
