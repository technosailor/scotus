And this is a point that the state's amicus brief, I think, makes very well about how there can be state law questions about community property and other things that actually some of these exceptions to discharge aren't clear. But just moving beyond that, because I think you're asking about the policy rationale behind this, I think we need to think about, if Congress were making a decision about this, what interest it would consider because it's always when it's putting together bankruptcy provisions trying to -- trying to balance the various interests.

The fact that Congress was so specific when it wanted to allow this payment of attorneys' fees in the three -- in the -- in the context of Section 362(k), we actually show -- we think shows that it's different from this case because Congress used different language. It wanted to make sure that there would be payment of these fees so it put that language in there.

In particular, in this case, just to make sure that it's clear, all we did was go to a state court where we were already in proceedings and be forthright with that state court about the fact that there had been a bankruptcy discharge and that we had a contractual right to attorneys' fees and that we weren't sure whether we could get the attorneys' fees under that contract.
