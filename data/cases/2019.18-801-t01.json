And we think the Federal Circuit -- the Fourth Circuit was right at least to the extent of saying the absence -- not only the absence of a prevailing party requirement, but the specific mandate that the expenses be paid regardless of the outcome of the proceedings is a good indication that this provision is trying to accomplish something very different from what an ordinary fee shifting provision is intended to accomplish.

And I think you could infer from that fact that Congress intended only that the trial stage of the Section 145 proceedings, the thing that was distinctive to a Section 145 suit, to be subject to this mandate. And the third thing is, even in the trial -- with respect to the trial court proceedings in this case, the PTO didn't seek recoupment of expenses for attorney time spent arguing about the fees.
