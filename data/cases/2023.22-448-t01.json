The text of the Constitution shows that when the Framers wanted to limit Congress's appropriations authority, they did so expressly."

The first Congress did exactly this with the very first agency it created, the Customs Service, and the same is true for other founding-era agencies, including the Post Office, the National Mint, the Patent Office, revenue officers, and the National Bank. And Congress has used this kind of appropriation as the default when funding financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The CFPB's appropriation fits squarely within this unbroken line of historical practice."

Respondents argue that the combination of features in the CFPB statute violates some previously unrecognized constitutional line. But the Bureau's appropriation is materially identical to the numerous funding statutes I just listed, and Respondents concede those statutes are constitutional. This Court should reject Respondents' attempt to gerrymander a rule to fit the CFPB alone without providing a coherent theory about how to interpret and apply the Appropriations Clause. I welcome the Court's questions."

And I guess what I would say is that if -- if you're looking at it through that lens, then history should play a powerful role in trying to understand the limits or scope of, you know, how much Congress can give away, when does it become too much. And, here, the Court doesn't need to articulate any outer limits because we have a very specific type of appropriation that's actually far more constrained than many that Congress has enacted throughout history because Congress provided funding for a single agency and actually capped that amount of funding in an amount not to exceed the cap set by Congress."

                "text": "So I think that, obviously, these concepts of separation of powers and the scope of the Appropriations Clause and non-delegation principles have in -- in many respects potentially overlapping functions. In this context, we understood Respondents to be making an argument about the Appropriations Clause in particular, and the Fifth Circuit found that they hadn't separately raised a non-delegation challenge. You know, I guess what I would say is that to the extent the Court is thinking about this from the perspective of general separation of powers principles, the -- the things that the Court generally consults in understanding the structural provisions of the Constitution are, first, the text, and, second, the history. Those indicators of intent here are overwhelmingly on our side. And then, if the Court is thinking about it from delegation principles, I think there too you would have to look at history. And as Justice Scalia emphasized in his concurring opinion in Clinton versus City of New York, if you look across the course of history from 1789 on, it has been, in the appropriations context, marked by very broad delegations of authority to the executive branch to spend within the bounds set by Congress. And the very first appropriations laws were structured like this one in the sense of providing that the executive could spend up to a -- a cap that was set by Congress itself. So I think that, you know, the cleanest way to think about the arguments Respondents are presenting is under the Appropriations Clause, but I recognize that as the Court is thinking more broadly about these issues, the other doctrines could come into play."

Just first on severability, Dodd-Frank itself has an express severability clause. This Court emphasized that point in Seila Law. And, here, the Fifth Circuit didn't even stop to consider whether any aspect of the CFPB's funding mechanism could be severed or would provide a basis to therefore limit the damage to Congress's work in trying to get this agency funded. I think that was error and that there are several candidates for severability that would be a much less disruptive remedy in this context and would not entitle Respondents to any relief because the Payday Lending Rule they challenge isn't traceable to those features or aspects of the funding mechanism. But even if you followed the Fifth Circuit's approach and thought that there was something about this entire funding mechanism that's invalid, even then I don't think a retrospective remedy is warranted. You know, the Court would be writing on a blank slate because no court had previously found that Congress itself violated the Appropriations Clause, but under traditional remedial equitable principles, it's necessary to take into account the public interest and the balance of the equities. And, here, a prospective remedy which would prevent the CFPB from enforcing this rule against Respondents until it has a valid appropriation would give them a meaningful form of relief."

I would point in particular to the amicus brief that was filed by the Mortgage Bankers Association that explains how many entities in various industries have critically relied on the CFPB's regulations, including, in particular, in the housing finance space. These create safe harbors for lenders so that they will be deemed to be in compliance with statutory requirements on things like ability to pay and on disclosure requirements. And if the Fifth Circuit is right and there's the prospect that all of these actions should be unwound, it would create profound disruption in various economic -- economic markets that would hurt the -- the regulated entities themselves."

And you said to Justice Alito that the Customs Department comes awfully close, but I -- I want you to step back a little bit and -- and just talk to me about, you know, how should we be -- how should we be thinking about that question?

Obviously, with respect to each of these challenged features, we think we have a wealth of evidence regarding standing appropriations or appropriations up to a particular cap. But I don't want to lose sight of the fact that if the Court were to approach this issue looking at the combination of features, this is not novel, and I -- I want to try to unpack a little bit why that's so, because Justice Alito had asked me a couple of questions about the source of the funding and, in particular, about the idea that maybe the line that got crossed here or the relevant difference in how the CFPB is funded is because it draws its funds from the Federal Reserve Board. And I think the reason why that doesn't work and why it shows that this is not unprecedented is that the whole theory behind that premise is that that's a constraint on other agencies."

But that's not accurate as a descriptive matter with respect to things like the Federal Reserve Board itself, which regulates and assesses money on the Federal Reserve Banks required to stay in the system. They can't leave. And if the overall value here is to determine does the agency have some limiting check on the overall amount of funds, the CFPB is far more constricted because it has a statutory cap actually imposed by Congress rather than regulated entities. And I think, if the Court is looking at all of the features together, maybe some things subtract out Congress a little bit, but the cap adds in Congress in a very powerful and major way that I think distinguishes this appropriation for purposes of congressional control."

You know, it was funded through a standing appropriation for the first 120 years of this nation's history, and then, in 1912, Congress took it out of a standing appropriation and brought it into annual appropriations. Congress just did this again in the debt limit bill recently."

So I'm concerned that there might be burden-shifting happening in the way in which we're thinking about this, and so maybe you can help me just to keep the -- the right burdens in the right place. Some of the questions that have been asked this morning are -- seem to be requiring you to establish whether or not Congress can do certain things, can -- you know, what if Congress, you know, delegated the authority to -- to determine a trillion dollars worth of funding and how the agency was going to do it? What if Congress set it up in this way or that way, et cetera? But I sort of thought that the burden was on them to show that Congress can't set up the agency in this way, and the reason I think that is because of the language of the Appropriations Clause and the way in which it seems to give the legislature the prerogative of the purse."

The closest I can think of throughout history is the Customs Service from 1849 to 1912, where they had a $1.5 million standing appropriation, but they were, one, subject to the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury, who received regular appropriations, and, two, that amount wasn't even enough, which is why it went back for regular appropriations."
