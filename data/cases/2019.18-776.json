  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Pedro Pablo Guerrero-Lasprilla, a native and citizen of Colombia, entered the United States in 1986 as a legal immigrant but was removed in 1998 due to felony drug convictions. In September 2016, Guerrero filed a motion to reopen, claiming that the 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in <em>Matter of Abdelghany</em> rendered him eligible to seek relief under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c). The immigration judge denied Guerrero\u2019s motion to reopen, finding it not timely filed. Given that <em>Abdelghany</em> was decided in 2014, the immigration judge found the two-year delay in filing the motion to reopen indicated Guerrero had not diligently pursued his rights as required for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, finding that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. And the BIA agreed with the immigration judge that equitable tolling did not apply to extend the 90-day deadline. Guerrero argued that he could not have filed his motion to reopen until the Fifth Circuit issued its decision in <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/14-60865/14-60865-2016-07-28.html\"><em>Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch</em>, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016)</a> (holding that a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations if he establishes \u201cthat he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d).</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Fifth Circuit found it lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that equitable tolling did not apply. Within the Fifth Circuit, under <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/16-60286/16-60286-2018-02-28.html\"><em>Penalva v. Sessions</em>, 884 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 2018)</a> the question whether a litigant acted diligently in attempting to reopen removal proceedings for purposes of equitable tolling is a factual question, not a question of law, and thus is not reviewable.</p>\n",
