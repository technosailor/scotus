Through the text of the FTCA, Congress provides two independent and easily administrable rules that control the application of the judgment bar. First, the judgment bar does not apply to claims brought together in a single action. As Will and Simmons explained, the text of Section 2676 imports common law res judicata. In the history of American law, res judicata has never been applied to claims brought together in a single action. Section 2676's requirement of the judgment in an action, not a judgment on a claim, demonstrates that Congress did not intend a judgment bar to depart from that common law history. Second, the judgment bar does not apply to claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction."

We've -- we've, I think, long held that in a case like -- like this one, where, if you make a determination under the merits, there isn't the established jurisdiction against the United States, that they're treated the same.

So the -- the most narrow way this Court could look at that is to look at a case like this and simply say the district court itself entered a judgment under 12(b)(1). Therefore, it concluded pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3) that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. The -- the -- the middle ground position is the position from Meyer, which is that to trigger the jurisdiction of Section 1346, a claim has to allege a valid cause of action, which is also consistent with this Court's dealing with the sovereign immunity statute in Helmerich and Payne. Only in the very broadest understanding, which is brought in through the Arbaugh decision, do any of the concerns that you have raised come to light. And so this Court could easily dispose of this jurisdictional question without reaching that furthest ruling, but I'm happy to discuss it further if -- if Your Honor would like to do so."

It should not now be allowed to come to this Court and say: Jurisdiction and merits are the same and -- and merits should, therefore, prevail because, as Wright and Miller in the First Restatement and many other places have said, anytime jurisdiction's entwined with merits, jurisdiction controls, not merits. And if it were the other way around, the Court would be able to reach beyond its actual authority granted by Congress.

The Sixth Circuit explained at Petition Appendix 1A, Note 1, why the district court's judgment is best understood as a summary judgment in favor of the government, because both parties submitted a body of extensive evidentiary exhibits in support of the motion. But even if the Court concluded that the judgment was best understood as a dismissal for failure to state a claim, it makes no difference because it's still the judgment in an action under Section 1346(b), as Meyer explained, and this Court's canonical decision in Bell v. Hood makes clear that a dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief is a decision on the merits and, therefore, preclusive. The surest way to know Respondent's main argument on the question presented is incorrect is that it forces my friend into the extraordinary conclusion that the judgment bar is not triggered by a judgment in favor of the United States on the FTCA action."

The Court should not leave in place the Sixth Circuit's rather obvious mistaken interpretation of the judgment bar and, instead, decide the case in favor of Respondent on an alternative ground that no other court has accepted. And -- and even if -- if the Court were inclined to reach the alternative question, we think the text is unambiguous in our favor. Congress would have looked at a lawsuit like this one and said Respondent has an action under Section 1346(b) and an action under Bivens, and he has joined them together in a single lawsuit, but there's simply no way to read the phrase \"complete bar to any action\" to actually mean that Respondent is precluded only from bringing a subsequent action when that is exactly the common law rule that Congress expressly changed. In the 70 years since the judgment bar was enacted, the courts of appeals have overwhelmingly rejected this argument, and that's because, as Justice Breyer recognized, it directly conflicts with Congress's purpose. Congress's -- the rule that Respondent advocates would permit a plaintiff to sue the United States and win and then continue pursuing individual government employees for additional relief just because he brought his two actions together in the same lawsuit."
