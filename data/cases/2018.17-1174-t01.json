And the Court doesn't want a rule where an officer can be haled into court on any routine arrest and forced to defend the purity of his motives, however reasonable his actions. Nor should the Court want a rule that gives officers a reason to hesitate in situations where they should be able to act decisively. I want to start with the point about complexity because I believe this case has all the elements the Court identified in Lozman. One, speech can be a valid consideration for the officers in deciding whether to effectuate an arrest."

I just think that -- that the first one that you -- you sketched out where it's sort of the weighing of the evidence, I think, if you look through the cases, that's going to allow all these things to go to the jury. And that was the one thing I wanted to say to you, Justice Alito, which is, look, I think we have by far the best reading of the common law in Hartman, but even if the Court disagrees with us doctrinally, if you look at the cases, you just do a simple Westlaw search for retaliatory arrest, hundreds and hundreds, about 250 in the Ninth Circuit alone, just post-Reichle, just in the last five years, the number of those that have credible allegations of your second scenario, very few."

Now I don't think you can do just the arrest because, you know, you get back to the station house, you consult with the prosecutors, and it turns out the statute's different than the statute you thought, so it's not waving the weapon, it's reckless endangerment, but everybody knows it's the same course of conduct. But you could set some timeline on it like that, and we suggested in our brief as a -- as a fallback from Devenpeck that where you have criminal charges, it's the charges identified up to and through the criminal complaint, or, in the absence of charges, it's the first stage in the civil litigation when the defendants say, look, you haven't shown a lack of probable cause, there was probable cause for these offenses, and their response to the motion to dismiss, you could limit it there so you wouldn't end up with the Lozman-type situation where you have parties casting about at -- at trial."

Did -- did -- did Mr. MacCoy have reason to fear Officer Weight when Officer Weight was standing half the distance that ultimately Officer Weight and Mr. Bartlett were standing? Mr. Bartlett -- the evidence in this case from Mr. Bartlett's standpoint is he approached Officer Weight in a non-threatening manner and simply communicated with Officer Weight in a manner that accomplished him being able to hear that communication. So the idea that this is people screaming at each other in a church simply isn't borne out by the facts of the case."
