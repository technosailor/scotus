If \"federal statutes\" means all statutes other than FNHRA itself, then that seems to me pretty strong evidence that there are no other remedies except those found in, for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act of '73. That is to say, the Savings Clause says are -- these rights are for any other federal -- are in addition to other federal statutes."

The question about third-party beneficiaries and the scope of the cause of action I would have thought arose only when we're talking about implied causes of action, like Cummings last term, for example. If you're talking about it against a private party, if you're wanting to know what a private party might have signed up for and you're talking about an implied cause of action from the statute itself, then it might make sense to ask whether a third-party beneficiary was entitled to sue or whether punitive damages would have been available for this kind of breach."

First, they offer no evidence that the Congress that enacted Section 1983 would have viewed breach-of-contract suits by third parties as remotely relevant to the new tort it was creating. Second, Petitioners can't show that their rule was the sort of well-settled background principle that Congress incorporates into a statute silently.

What's different about this case is that Congress was acting in an area where a substantial number of the participants are private parties, and Congress contemplated providing a private cause of action against those private parties but left that out of the ultimate bill it enacted. And so we know that Congress believed that the administrative enforcement mechanism it was creating was sufficient for the 90 percent of nursing home residents who -- who live in privately operated -- operated facilities, and we think that's a very strong indication that it -- it didn't believe that a private cause of action --"

And so allowing Section 1983 suits that would sort of bypass that administrative enforcement mechanism and lead to funds being taken out of the nursing home system would be inconsistent with that congressional choice. I do want to take a moment -- I haven't gotten any questions on the first question presented, but I do want to bring up the 1994 statutes, which, to the extent that there is any doubt about whether Thiboutot was correctly decided, we think that the two legislative ratifications that Congress adopted in 1994 put that to rest."

The only point of departure is that the United States believes that Congress showed a clear intention to preclude access to 1983 by extending FNHRA rights to residents of private nursing homes, even though they're not able to use 1983 to enforce those rights because 1983 only permits suits against government actors. That gets the statute backwards. FNHRA's text and context show that when Congress enacted the statute in 1987, it wanted to preserve access to all available remedies for FNHRA violations to the greatest extent possible. Thus, as no one disputes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of nursing home residents to sue to enforce their FNHRA rights in private lawsuits under state tort law."

And the answer to that question is that the common law, generally speaking, prohibited individuals from bringing third-party beneficiary claims on government contract cases. By the way -- and this goes back, Justice Sotomayor's question, that you asked me -- you said, well, what about these legal history professors who say the law was different? I contend that they misread the law by, as I say, gerrymandering the denominator, but, even if it were as murky as the law professors suggest that it was, the burden is not on us, I suggest, to show that the law was clear on our side. The burden is on the plaintiff, who's asking that a certain right be created and enforced to show that it was settled in their direction."
