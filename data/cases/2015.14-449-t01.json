And to go back to Justice Kagan's question about the intuitive difference between these two things, they're between -- excuse me -- trials and -- and penalty-phase proceedings, the answer is that's because in a -- in a trial, the -- the relative culpability of the defendants makes a big difference with respect to who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a principal, who's an aider and abettor.
