And when you put the former, which I agree is sort of like well back in the past with the latter, which is continual, Congress never wants to impose burdens on the taxpayer with respect to bankruptcy, you know, it thinks that the people who use bankruptcy should pay for bankruptcy, then it seems to me that there's a pretty strong case that Ms. Hansford says that it should be equalization by collection."

And I wondered that too, you know, outside of the Dormant Commerce Clause context or the tax context. But, as I was sitting down, like, with my law clerk and we were debating this, we were trying to figure out, in many equal protection cases, which would be, you know, similar to the Uniformity Clause, where you're talking about discriminatory treatment, the kind of relief sought is just to end the disparity moving forward and it's equitable relief that's sought, which seems to me a possible distinction between citizenship and -- and those sorts of things.

And the other point I'd like to make too is even if the Court -- and this goes somewhat to what does Congress really want here. The -- the Court could order a refund, and if my friends are right that there's actually no due process problem with asking people to pay money, you know, well over half a decade after the fact and there's no problem with disturbing closed and final bankruptcy cases where bankruptcy puts a premium on finality, there's no problem with overriding a confirmed plan of reorganization that is final, non-appealable, then Congress can pass a law tomorrow, the day after this Court's decision, that says, in fact, we don't want refunds; in fact, claw back those funds.
