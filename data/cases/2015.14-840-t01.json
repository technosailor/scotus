So their position seems to be although we can pay -- we can't pay incentive payments to increase retail demand, we can pay incentive payments to reduce retail demand. Two observations about that: One is, why in the world would that make sense? I mean, why in the world would -- would Congress have divided the authority here in a way that allows the Federal government to suppress retail demand but not increase retail demand? The second thing that I want to say about that anomaly, though, is the line between sales and nonsales can't be the right line because it -- if it is, then not only can they do what Justice Scalia suggested, which is have FERC pay a direct bounty not to purchase.

And the point I was making about the Southern company brief is operating in an area without ISOs, without RTOs, so without FERC, they actually have a greater level of demand response than other parts of the country that have the Federal rule. So to bring us to the arbitrary and capriciousness question, I think, Justice Kennedy, the way I think about it is that we have both procedural objections and substantive objections.

And of course, another irony here is the distortion is greatest in those markets where the States have done exactly what FERC would like, which is adopt retail price -- realtime pricing, because then the retail price is LMP.

So it -- it certainly meets the threshold test of -- of -- of an adequate explanation for a decision. Now, if I could sum up, I think this is what this case comes down to. On one side of the scale, you've got a practice that saves billion -- that has saved billions of dollars in wholesale costs and will save billions of dollars, and it's an effective tool against blackouts and brownouts, and that nobody has shown in the real world does any harm. You have a statutory provision that gives FERC specific authority to regulate this practice. You have no statutory provision precluding it. You have Chevron in case there's any doubt.
