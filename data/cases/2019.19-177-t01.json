And, as I said at the outset, I think two simple principles resolve the case. Respondents themselves are not subject to a funding condition, so they can't have an unconstitutional conditions claim, and the foreign entities that are subject to the funding condition have no constitutional rights, so they can't have an unconstitutional condition claim either.

So we certainly encourage groups to do that kind of work, and it's not at all in tension with the -- with the policy requirement.

Now I do want to reiterate that I think the concerns you have raised, while legitimate, are -- are -- are not borne out in practice because the policy requirement, whether applied in the past to domestic groups or now to foreign groups, does not require them to tell prostitutes that they oppose prostitution or to do anything affirmative beyond agreeing to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking in the letter.

And they're also free to make a different choice, which is to work through a foreign affiliate that, as a result of Respondents' own choice, will have to make the policy statement opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. But, even in that instance, Respondents are still free to use their own speech rights to explain that -- that they don't share the views of the foreign affiliate on prostitution and sex trafficking. I -- I think, ultimately, what Respondents are asking for is a sort of right to optimal message management, which is simply not what the First Amendment protects. If you look at cases like Rumsfeld versus FAIR, the Court explained that the law schools in that case might well be concerned about misattribution of their position on -- on letting military recruiters onto campus, and yet that concern alone was not a reason to find an unconstitutional conditions violation. And -- and likewise, in the Court's other funding cases, like Rust, for example, and Regan, the entities were ultimately not allowed to operate in their preferred manner."

The U.S. entity has a separate choice to accept Leadership Act funds itself and operate itself without -- in -- in foreign countries without any risk of hypocrisy or -- or a mixed message. As Justice Gorsuch says, you have to take the sweet with the sour when you decide to set up a separate corporate entity.
