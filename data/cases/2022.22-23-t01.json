The wheels of justice can be obstructed even before they begin to move. Indeed, one of the best ways to obstruct an investigation or a proceeding is to ensure that it never starts in the first place. My friends on the other side say that only 14 states plus D.C. even punished obstruction of justice in 1996 and that Congress meant to limit obstruction of justice to a catch-all offense in the federal Criminal Code that includes a pending proceeding requirement. But, by 1996, Congress had added other obstruction-of-justice offenses without any such limitation, and it had expressly disavowed such a limit in 1982 when creating the principal federal witness and evidence tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. 1512. Also by 1996, case law, dictionaries, leading commentators, and the Model Penal Code had all recognized that the kinds of offenses at issue in these two cases -- accessory after the fact and witness tampering -- involved obstruction of justice even when the elements of the offense did not require there to be a pending investigation or proceeding at the time of the offense conduct. This Court should hold that the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding otherwise. I welcome the Court's questions."

That tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it said obstruction of justice. There are 15 states that in 1996 defined crimes of obstruction of justice, and more than half required a pending proceeding. We counted eight, and then the government rightly pointed out in their reply in Footnote 8 that we undercounted because we have the right to claim Virginia.
