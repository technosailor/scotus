In addition to all of that, from an ex ante point of view, just thinking about what rule makes sense here, under the IRS's view, as soon as they make an assessment, again, an internal bookkeeping notation, as soon as they do that, that turns off the notice and judicial review provisions that Congress created in 7609(a) and (b). That gives them no incentive to be reasonable, and it leads them to issue overbroad summonses, like the ones that you can see in the Petition Appendix at 71a. In a universe like the one that Congress actually designed, where, before Congress can get information from innocent third parties, it actually has to think what do we really need here because it's going to be subject to judicial review, probably they wouldn't have issued such an overbroad summons in the first place."

But Donaldson simply involved liability investigation summonses, and it said that a taxpayer who is the subject of a liability investigation summons was not generally entitled to judicial review of that summons. Congress wanted to overturn that result as to liability investigation summonses, but it did not want to disturb the IRS's ability to promptly and efficiently collect taxes at the collection phase."

And then the -- the House and Senate reports also both say that they're carving out express -- they expressly say that they're carving out an exception for summonses issued in aid of collection. And if I could just -- just step -- take a step back and put this in perspective a little bit, and this, I think, goes to the colloquy I had with the Chief Justice. The IRS has long faced a persistent problem of tax collection evasion."
