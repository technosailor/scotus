And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of -- of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention.

First, the Old Chief stipulation is entered with counsel at or around -- by the beginning of the trial ordinarily, so it's a counsel stipulation that the defendant has the felon status and, in Mr. Greer's case, does not address whether he knew his status at the time of the gun possession. And then, in terms of the -- the record and the appellate court's approach to this, Mr. Greer, like other pre-Rehaif defendants, entered into that stipulation based on the uniform precedent at the time and were not, you know, acting with any bad intent at -- as to how the government would have proven its case without the error. But, in fact, that's what I would point to, is without the error, an appellate court can't just look at what the government says it could have produced without that information and actually being produced to a fact-finder and subjected to the adversarial testing by the defendant because, at that point, then the court -- the appellate court is just picturing half of a hypothetical trial."

It maintains the appellate courts' role as a reviewer of errors rather than as an initial fact-finder of a defendant's guilt or likely guilt. Second, it thus maintains a review of whether the government has proven a defendant's guilt through sufficient evidence at his trial. And, third, it provides a clear line to the appellate courts that avoids future litigation over what information not introduced at trial could be relied on to determine the defendant's guilt.

Our rule would allow courts to evaluate -- evaluate all of the available evidence and grant case-specific relief whenever it would be genuinely unfair to hold a defendant to his forfeiture. Petitioner's rule, by contrast, would grant a windfall to defendants, like Petitioner himself, who cannot reasonably claim to have been unaware of their felon status. And the second, related point is that Petitioner has really provided no reason at all for requiring courts to ignore evidence in the record at the final step of plain-error review. Petitioner is asking the court to grant him discretionary relief from his forfeiture, and he bears the burden of showing that it would be fundamentally unfair not to do so. If he had a plausible argument about why the sentencing evidence was unreliable or didn't tell the whole story, he'd be free to make that argument, but he has no right to insist that courts just pretend like the evidence doesn't exist in deciding whether to give him the discretionary relief he wants. We ask the Court to affirm."
