That -- this is something -- again, it's fine to talk about the generalities of the law, but when you're trying to think about congressional intent, please don't lose sight of the fact -- of the fundamental implausibility and the anomaly of saying, when Congress took Puerto Rico out of Chapter 9, that it meant to leave that Chapter 9 preemption provision in place, and thus leave Puerto Rico in the dire situation that led the Commonwealth to use its police powers to enact this Recovery Act in the first place.
