And that seems to me a really messy and odd way, as opposed to just saying today we have a test, you're bringing this question, I thought the question presented here was is this jurisdictional, you're bringing it to us today, and we're going to apply the test we had today, and to the extent that it's different than what we said in the past, we just chalk it up to the fact that we have a new rule of decision."

Those decisions were clearly correct under then-governing law, and, indeed, this Court later cited them as controlling authority for the settled principle that conditions on a waiver of sovereign immunity should be treated as jurisdictional. Petitioners now ask this Court to disregard its jurisdictional holdings in Block and Mottaz, arguing that this Court's intervening decisions have made it harder to show that a restriction is jurisdictional and that under the new test the time bar here should be treated as just a claim-processing rule. For three reasons, the Court should reject that invitation."

A few years later, after Congress amended the Quiet Title Act, North Dakota was able to sue again, and this time around, because those findings had been vacated, the United States was successful on the merits, whereas previously it had been unsuccessful. So the jurisdictional treatment was dispositive of the conflict at issue there."
