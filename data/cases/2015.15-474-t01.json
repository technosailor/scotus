So I -- I think that if you look at the indictment the way that it's actually structured, it talks about a person who, as opportunities arose, was going to engage in \"official acts.\" This is a theory of corruption that Justice Sotomayor's opinion in Ganim in the Second Circuit validated, and it was cited in Skilling as a perfectly valid theory of corruption. And, therefore, the individual \"official acts\" really form a composite window into Petitioner's mind.",

And the only way that Petitioner could win, if you agree with me on the sufficiency issue, is if you conclude that jury instructions must exempt certain types of official actions, like directing your Secretary of Health to take a meeting, which is a very kind of significant event in the life of a cabinet member and a governor, or hosting an event at the mansion, can't possibly count, because it somehow should be viewed as social, when, in fact, what the Governor is doing is allowing his benefactor to get all the people in the room who he wants to influence to do the studies. So in my view, there was nothing wrong -- if I can complete the sentence -- in the way that the indictment structured the crime in this case.",

First, I'd like to start out with the government's argument that a lot of the problems with its theory are solved by the quid pro quo requirement. Well, in fact, the gratuity statute, the Federal gratuity statute, has the exact same \"official act\" requirement, but no quid pro quo requirement at all. So what that means is that if you take somebody to a fancy lunch with a -- I can't remember the name of the bottle of wine you mentioned, Justice Breyer, but if you took them to that fancy lunch to thank them for referring you to a meeting with a mid-level staffer, even if there was no suggestion at all that you were going to do anything other than call that staffer and say, hey, can you take a meeting with this guy, hear him out, and exercise your independent judgment, that would be a violation of the Federal gratuity statute. And, indeed, under the government's broad theory that anything within the range of official duties counts, that means that if you took the person out to that lunch as thanks for giving you a tour of the Capitol Building, you would likewise have violated the Federal gratuity statute, because there, there is no quid pro quo requirement at all.
