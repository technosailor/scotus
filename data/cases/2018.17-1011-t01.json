That's interpreting the Judiciary Act, which goes all the way back to the founding, of course, and says where the common law is competent to give a remedy, such and such a remedy is permissible. And in Steamboat, the Court rejected the exact argument the other side makes here, which is, first of all, that the law had to be incorporated at the time of suit and, second of all, that there was something different about the common law as to a statute at the time of the enactment."

So either pathway, whether, Justice Breyer, you start with the way you've always looked at cases, with the word \"is\" and the word \"same\" and the reference canon that I've described and say all of those things lead you to a time of suit rule, or if you start with the law of 1945 and say, what was the law in 1945? Well, Hoffman and -- in Ex Parte Peru were clear that the law of 1945 was the executive branch decides, and it's not for the Court -- this is -- I'm going to give you the Court's own language -- it's not for the Court to give immunity where the executive branch has not seen fit to give it. And if that were the test, you'd come right back to where you -- where I started here, which is that the FSIA would control or, at the bare minimum, the executive branch position in this lawsuit on the type of immunity that ought to apply in this situation would control."

If I understand the other side's position correctly, basically, the question they're having -- they would want every federal court to ask in these cases is, what would the Truman Administration's State Department have wanted to do in this case? And when you have things like this, which didn't even -- an organization that didn't even exist at the time, sometimes doing activities that weren't even contemplated at the time, things like sovereign wealth funds, which foreign sovereigns now engage in, for example, who knows what the State Department would have thought then.

One subsection, subsection (a), says that the same immunity rules apply, and subsection (b) says that foreign officials -- I'm sorry, international organization officials are entitled to absolute immunity. So this is yet another reason why if the other side were correct and if Congress had wanted to lay down the rule they did, why would they not have just used the absolute immunity language in subsection (b) of subsection (d) and that, indeed, was the original draft of this act that was discarded. So I could go on, but I'd rather save the rest of my time for rebuttal."

It must be based on commercial activity that occurs in the United States. We think the Court's decision in OBB makes clear that the way you apply that is to ask: What's the gravamen of this suit? It's not enough to have some attenuated connection, but what's the gravamen? And the gravamen of this suit as we understand it is -- is tortious conduct that occurred in India, injuries that occurred in India."

And -- and this lawsuit is that -- that the entity that we loan this money to didn't live up to the standards and it's our fault, and so we're being sued here. Well, it's going to create -- if that kind of a suit can go forward, and hopefully it won't be able to, Mr. Chief Justice, but if it can, it's certainly going to create an extraordinary disincentive for organizations like ours to lien into those kinds of standards because we're going to be hoisted by our own petard.
