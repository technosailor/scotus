So we think that it is not necessary for the Court to reach -- to get into Chevron deference here because we simply think we have the better interpretation of the statutory text. If the Court was inclined, if the Court thought that the statute is ambiguous, I think that the combination of various sources where the government has consistently interpreted this statute the same way that we do since 1991 in a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, in a decision that was approved as lawful by the Attorney General, and in a response to notice-and-comment rulemaking, all would make the case for deference very easy."

And if I might just make -- say one more thing about why I think that sort of judicially modest course is particularly appropriate here, it's because the Court has recognized that in immigration law in particular, Congress has expressly delegated interpretive authority to the Attorney General.

Second is the direct textual parallelism between the two-part lawful status benefit in the TPS statute and the two-part lawful status requirement for adjustment of status, which suggests the TPS statute doesn't address the other requirements for adjustment of status like admission. Third is the fact that the lawful status benefit is available only \"during the TPS period,\" which I think is strong evidence that it does not retroactively cure pre-TPS conduct that made the person ineligible for adjustment of status. And finally are all the other places in the INA where Congress has expressly authorized various classes of aliens to adjust their status, notwithstanding their entry without admission."

Now, with respect to the question of whether admission is inherent in non-immigrant status, when it comes to non-immigrants, those are not distinct concepts. A great example of that is Section 1258 governing a change of status, which Congress expressly cross-referenced in (f)(4), the provision at issue. That provision explains that the agency maintains a non-immigrant classification \"in the case of any alien lawfully admitted to the United States as a non-immigrant who is continuing to maintain that status.\" Congress there expressly equated the concept of being admitted as a non-immigrant with having lawful status as a non-immigrant, and that is entirely consistent with how that concept is treated throughout the INA. Now I think I heard government counsel to concede that if you look in every tunnel and on every mountain in this country, every single non-immigrant, except for alien crewmen and U visa holders, are, in fact, admitted. Alien crewmen are the exception that proves the rule because Congress had to create an express exception for them in the statute. And as to the U visa non-immigrants, who did not exist in 1990, the statute, which is Section 1255(m) -- (m)(1)(A), expressly refers to them as -- as having been admitted."
