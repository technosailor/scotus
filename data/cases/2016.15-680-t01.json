I think in the south side of -- of Virginia, which is two districts, 75 and 63, this was a curious one, because he actually found race did predominate in 75 by splitting Dinwiddie County -- Dinwiddie County being a border county of North Carolina -- on a validly racial grounds, but yet did not find race predominated with respect to 63. It's difficult to understand how race could have predominated in the racial division of voters on one side of the line, but not predominate in the racial division of voters on the other.",
