Reed, where it was 130,000-plus petitioners who could have their First Amendment interests all adjudicated together. As we understand what California is requiring, it's not just an extremely onerous standard that's essentially impossible to meet, but you'd have tens of thousands of charities all having to go to court to try to vindicate their First Amendment interest.

And if every charity that's in this position and has concerns about exposure of their donors has to go down that same winding path, then the First Amendment will have lost before the next as-applied challenge begins. And -- and we think, analytically, doctrinally, in terms of precedent, it's especially clear in the First Amendment context that if we convince you there are a substantial number of instances where the law is unconstitutional, that warrants facial invalidation. Here, we think it is unconstitutional in all its applications when you have a charity that doesn't want to produce its Schedule B, and California has no narrow tailoring. And, if I may, Justice -- Justice Gorsuch, at JA 42022, you have California officials specifically testifying they never considered even a narrow alternative."

What's the difference? If we hold in your opinion, the government's view -- if we were to hold against you and for the broader claims of the rule at issue in this case that the Petitioner brings, how would you distinguish disclosure in the campaign finance context? The right at issue, you heard Justice Thomas very eloquently explain that right, and it would certainly seem to apply as much. And the need in the political fora, money is involved in both cases, and the need to give anonymously would seem as strong, and you could argue about the government's interest. So, if that broad interest exists here, how would you -- and wins, how would you distinguish campaign finance, or would you?"

Disclosure requirements are different because this Court has recognized that they may affect each in association, but they do so only indirectly, and so it's necessary in every case to take account of the actual burden that's presented with respect to First Amendment rights. And I think that that explains why a facial challenge should not succeed here, because there is no evidence in this record that there is any kind of widespread substantial burden in the typical application of this statute to the typical person contributing to a charity. The evidence the Petitioners had focused on the harm to their own donors."

The relevant question is whether the states should be foreclosed from regulating in a particular way based on a showing that the disclosure requirement truly creates First Amendment burdens. And I'll just emphasize as well that there are an array of amicus briefs on the other side, including from associations of nonprofits -- the California Association of Nonprofits with 10,000 member organizations, the National Council of Nonprofits with 25,000 member organizations -- and what those briefs suggest is that there is a critical role to be played in having the state police charitable fraud to ensure that donors have confidence in charitable organizations, which itself increases the -- the willingness to donate and, therefore, the pursuit of philanthropic efforts."

And -- and, Justice Barrett, just to close the loop on this, I do think that the court of appeals here considered alternatives. It specifically discussed the audit letters, subpoenas, and explained why those would be less effective at allowing California to make use of Schedule Bs at the outset in responding to complaints before it formally opened an investigation and cited that tip-off concern and other concerns related to having that information at an early stage.

But the other relevant legal standard is that organizations need to have a meaningful opportunity to claim an as-applied exemption from compelled disclosure when it would subject their particular donors to harassment or intimidation. Petitioners presented evidence of these kinds of harms, and we think the court of appeals should have considered that evidence in measuring the chilling effect of this law as applied.

Stevens, without the Court asking how many groups out there would be interested in animal crush videos and how many would just follow the general chilling of reproach that was reflected in the statute, as opposed to wanting to continue to publicize those videos. You can know, as you sit where you sit, that, in fact, a substantial number of charities and many multiples of their donors are going to have the same interests that these Petitioners do and suffer the same constitutional deprivation absent facial invalidation. And that's the same judgment that the Court made in Shelton, making that predictive judgment, as Justice Barrett put it, as to teachers, some of whom might have had associations with the PTA and -- and other innocuous associations, but the Court recognized that there would be an inherent chilling effect. What we have in our record vividly illustrates just how pernicious the chill can be, just how real the threat to donors is, but that's always been baked into this Court's precedents, and it should remain baked in, and it's a recipe for facial invalidation. That's especially true, Your Honors, because I'm delighted to hear both the United States and California agreeing today that means-end fit is required."

It is undisputed that California -- California's prophylactic suspicionless demand sweeps in the Schedule Bs of tens of thousands of charities annually, and there are many multiples of those charities in terms of the donors whose information is being placed at risk in this very threatening way. And -- and according to the record, Planned Parenthood's Schedule B, for instance, contained hundreds and hundreds of donors that were on there. The record also makes clear -- and -- and my friend, Ms. Feinberg, did not deny -- that California's never reading these Schedule Bs unless and until an external complaint comes in from a news story, from an internal whistleblower, from an aggrieved donor."

If you look at the Thomas More Law Center's Joint Appendix 197, you'll see Professor Schervish's testimony about the donor bill of rights and how important this principle is to charities as a general rule, and note the outpouring of amicus briefs, as -- as Your -- as Your Honors have today.
