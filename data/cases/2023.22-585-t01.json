So the question before us is, if we make a determination to take the dicta in Von Neumann and in the 8-8 whatever case, all right, to say that's the entire process you're ever due, do we leave open the possibility that there are states, jurisdictions that are abusing this process and not leaving us any arms to correct it? That's what we're doing, isn't it? If we say there's no overriding first question, is this process, the features of this process, are they enough, whether it's under Mathews or Barker, then what we're basically saying is go at it, states, take as much property as you want, keep it as long as you want, let's hold out no hope whatsoever that there's ever going to be any further process that's due?

So, if we have a scenario in which everyone agrees that the average time for a forfeiture proceeding is, say, six months after the seizure, and everybody agrees that that is reasonable for due process purposes, Plaintiff Number 1 doesn't receive her forfeiture hearing until 12 months after the seizure, so her claim is that the government was too slow in giving her the hearing. Meanwhile, Plaintiff Number 2 receives her hearing in six months, but she claims that at some point within those six months there should be an opportunity for the court to consider whether she should have been allowed to keep her car during that interim period. She's not complaining about the time. Six months is fine."

And I think Justice Sotomayor raises a very important point, which is that we know a lot more now than we did when $8,850 and the other case were decided about how civil forfeiture is being used in some states, about the kinds of abuses that it's subject to, about the kind of incentives operating on law enforcement officers that -- that tend toward those abuses.

The hearings that Petitioners request would upend that history, be extremely onerous, and would require more process for the pretrial deprivation of property than the pretrial detention of persons. Finally, if the government disagrees with our front-line position, while we think that $8,850 is the better fit for Petitioners' particular claims, the government is largely ambivalent about whether Eldridge or $8,850 applies to determine whether an interim hearing is required in a given case. But, either way, this Court's decision should emphasize that the public and government interests identified in $8,850 and Pearson Yacht will often weigh strongly against allowing such a hearing. I welcome the Court's questions."
