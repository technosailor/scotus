You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is, that women be provided these service -- services, with no hassle, no cost to them.

First, I would echo what the Solicitor General said in pointing out that Congress itself did not even specify that contraceptions would be included in the preventative health mandate. And Congress went further and said with respect to grandfathered plans, that there were other mandates in the Affordable Care Act, like coverage for people up to age 26 and preexisting conditions, that they were going to impose even on grandfathered plans, but they didn't impose the preventative mandate. So Congress itself recognized that tens of millions of employees could be in the same position as employees of the Little Sisters of the Poor even though there's no religious objection there whatsoever. And I think the clear teaching of RFRA is that when you're going to give those kind of exceptions to people for secular reasons, then you need to give those kind of exceptions to religious believers."

One of the anomalies here is that the government, from the beginning, has exempted religious orders, but they refuse -- if they -- if they stick to their knitting and do only religious services, but if, on the other hand, they -- they do what the Little Sisters do, which is go out and provide care for the elderly poor and for the sick, then they don't qualify for the exemption. And so maybe the Little Sisters will have to reconfigure their operations, but there's just nothing that they can do that will allow them to come into compliance with the plan, and so -- with -- with the government's mandate. And -- and I think that's what Congress had in mind with RFRA, because they understood that when people are faced with a government obligation that their religion absolutely forbids them to comply with, that's something that the government should try to avoid at all costs. To answer the second part of your question just quickly, the Little Sisters have never complied with the mandate throughout this entire litigation, and so what that means is two things. One, no one will lose their coverage that they have now if the Little Sisters are given this exemption, and, two, throughout that process, we have not heard of even a single employee who views this as a problem, presumably because many of these employees, even if they're not Catholic, because the Little Sisters hires on a non-discriminatory basis, but they've come to work for the Little Sisters understanding the mission of the Little Sisters, and I don't think they would really want to put the Little Sisters in the position that you alluded to of maybe having to stop serving the elderly poor."

But the third way, of course, to reject the reasoning of the Third Circuit is -- is to say, even if there was some sort of original sin in the promulgation of the IFRs, it was cured by the notice and comment that actually took place subsequently. And one feature of the Third Circuit opinion that I just want to draw attention to is the Third Circuit never faulted the government for responding to the thousands and thousands and thousands of comments it got in any kind of insufficient way.

And so it does seem to me that those are essentially other ways that the government has been able to comply.

Second, the agencies claim that RFRA, a statute that limits government action, affirmatively authorizes them to permit employers to deny women their rights to contraceptive coverage even in the absence of a RFRA violation in the first place.

So where a challenge is brought under the APA to a regulation, taking account of that final remedy that's available, granting preliminary relief on a nationwide basis is appropriate.
