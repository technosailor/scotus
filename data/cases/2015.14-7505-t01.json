And so, although it is not this Court's ordinary function to determine whether something was or wasn't harmless, as in Ring it was remanded for that purpose, I think in this case it manifestly was not harmless, and if there were a remand or any question by this Court on that count, it ought to be remanded to the State court, not only to determine constitutional harmlessness, but whether there was a waiver by the State in its deliberate choice never to mention this either to the second sentencing jury or thereafter.",

One is, in this case, where it's determined at the sentencing phase because of the finding within the jury's recommendation. In other instances it can be -- a person can become eligible before the sentencing phase either because they have a prior violent felony conviction or because they have a contemporaneous conviction. For example, if someone murdered two people and were convicted of double murder, that person at the guilt phase, by virtue of that guilt jury's verdict has been found to be eligible for the death penalty. And so at that stage, then in your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if that sentencing-phase jury recommended life, the judge could override it without violating Ring. Now, I will tell you that, as a matter of Florida State law, the judge in that circumstance would face an exacting standard; and, as a matter of fact, no judge has overwritten a jury's life recommendation since before Ring. So as a matter of function, it is just not something that happens in Florida. But to answer your question, we do believe it would be constitutional in the situation that I described.",
