To begin with -- with Your Honor's initial point about the underlying history, I agree if we look prior to the APA, there are cases that suggest in the statutory context that a department or agency's interpretation of the statute deserves binding deference. But, in the APA, Congress decided that there needed to be procedural protections to safeguard the interests of the public through notice-and-comment rule-making to provide the public the ability to participate in that law-making function that happens within the agency. That was one of the critical innovations of the APA that imposed on past practice as a matter of congressional direction, and we think that's what's lacking here."

As the Court said earlier this term, reasonable jurists can look at the language and, acting in good faith, come to different interpretations. One of the virtues of Seminole Rock is that when you're facing multiple reasonable interpretations, you vest the decision-making authority -- excuse me -- in a single party rather than multiple courts."

We've identified three of this Court's cases that arguably applied Seminole Rock in the face of inconsistent interpretations. In each three of those cases, the application of Seminole Rock appeared to be makeweight; in other words, the Court first explained why the agency's interpretation was likely the best one but then applied Seminole Rock in order to confirm that decision.

And it is always more faithful to -- to stare decisis principles to retain a doctrine at its core, while perhaps imposing limitations on the edge that simply recognize that, in the course of practical application, practical issues have been identified. And that's why we think that you ought to reinforce the requirement of genuine ambiguity, you ought to reinforce the -- the requirement that you wouldn't apply it to inconsistent interpretations, and we don't think the agency should get Seminole Rock deference for secret, private interpretations. It ought to give public notice of its interpretation, as it did in Seminole Rock itself. But we think that when you have those principal limitations, you've largely addressed the practical problems of Seminole Rock, and what you're left with, in our view, are the practical benefits of Seminole Rock. So even if you think it was wrongly decided as an original matter, it's got significant practical benefits, its practical problems are manageable, it's been on the books for decades, and this is something that Congress could fix if it believed that this Court has misgauged legislative intent in adopting the Seminole Rock doctrine."

And, here, we think that our interpretation, even if you don't think it is the theoretically best one, we think that it is more plausible than Petitioner's and, therefore, you wouldn't get to the application of the veteran's canon. But, again, our principal concern on behalf of both the VA and the other agencies throughout the United States is in preserving Seminole Rock in its core applications because that is an issue that transcends the facts of this case."

We certainly agree that agencies have a very substantial role to play in policy-making, but Congress made the judgment that the way that that is done in a democratic way accountable to the population is through notice-and-comment rule-making, such that the regulated public can provide their views. And that also accounts with the theoretical underpinnings of how this Court has explained that deference can be appropriate to agencies. There are two things that are required: first, a delegation of the subject matter but, second, that the agency acts in the particular manner that Congress has delegated the agency to -- to act within. In this context, as we've explained, the particular manner that the agency identified was through rule-making that provides the public that ability to participate."

In the event that there is some sort of emergency situation, the APA contemplates that for allowing for regulations pursuant to the good cause exception, if the agency can show that there is something that is akin to an emergency that would warrant something like a preliminary injunction in court. So Congress has provided for those sorts of emergency situations when the delay in -- in the regulatory process would actually pose some kind of practical problem. But, to turn additionally to the practical problems that exist in Auer deference, as the Chief Justice was explaining, I think you get a non-satisfactory result regardless of how courts apply it. If courts apply it as they did in this case to say we don't have to -- to really do much statutory or -- or textual construction to determine if both sides have an argument that looks plausible on the page, that we -- then we defer, that is not a particularly satisfactory answer. By contrast, if courts go far down the road of step one and do the interpretation but then ultimately decide, as many courts have had to do, that although we think the -- the agency has it wrong, as a matter of -- of interpretation, we still have to defer to the agency because it's close enough, that's also not a satisfactory answer."
