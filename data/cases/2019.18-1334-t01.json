And then, to reinforce that, there have been three times in the country's history where a question arose about whether a territorial judge could be impeached by Congress. And in each of those three instances, the political branches concluded that a territorial judge could not be impeached because a territorial judge was not a civil officer of the United States but only an officer of the territory exercising territorial power. Now, with respect to the governors, of course, you know, the -- the Appointments Clause is not an either/or proposition."
