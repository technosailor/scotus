First, under the statutory scheme, the EEOC's investigative authority is not plenary, like other agencies, but is cabined by the statutory limit of relevance to the charge under investigation, as this Court said in Shell Oil. Because this inquiry is extraordinarily contextualized, the district court's fact-intensive determination should be reviewed under a unitary abuse-of-discretion standard, as this Court has held. Second, the tradition of deferential appellate review is robust, not only for administrative subpoenas, but also for close analogs, such as search warrants and grand jury subpoenas. Third, the district court is the judicial actor best positioned to decide the issue for any number of reasons that this Court articulated in Pierce and is applied in subsequent cases.",

The first is that this Court indicated in Buford that when a district court just sees a lot more of a fact-specific question, the district court is often going to have more expertise in answering that question. And this Court has also indicated that when a determination is very case specific, the costs of appellate review are unlikely to justify the benefits of -- of -- are unlikely to justify the added time and expense that appellate review takes because a decision on case-specific facts is unlikely to yield substantial benefits -- substantial guidance for future cases.
