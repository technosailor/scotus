The Sixth Circuit kept the Attorney General out of court, and it made three fundamental errors in doing so. First, the panel overlooked that the Attorney General simply sought to pick up where the Secretary had left off in this litigation. More to the point, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, merely accepted a handoff from another state official to exhaust all appeals. Second, the panel refused to consider Kentucky's sovereign interests in enforcing and defending its law."

So I think the post-judgment part of it and insulating a decision from further review, especially for a sovereign state, is something that matters quite a bit to the analysis that we hope the Court adopts."

Finally, it is not disrespectful to the Attorney General's and Kentucky's sovereign interests to hold the Attorney General to his decision not to appeal, particularly when he can make the same arguments he made in his intervention motion through Rule 60(b).

And, of course, in Eisenstein, we were talk -- you were talking specifically -- the Court was talking specifically about the False Claims Act context, where there is a statute that says the United States can't participate unless it first intervenes.

I think, if anything, the fact that different political parties might choose to exercise that sovereign authority differently calls for this Court to be neutral in the face of that differential exercise of sovereign authority. And so, again, I think what separates this case is the fact that, if the Attorney General had never exercised that sovereign authority to decline to defend and to enter into a court-ordered stipulation and dismissal binding him to the judgment, then I think we would be more in the case of what Justice Breyer was describing, of a case in which the sovereign authority had -- the sovereign had never been given the chance perhaps to exercise or defend the statute and then now it was being taken away from it.

None of that is a violation of Kentucky's sovereign interests, and so that's what I think sets this case apart and why, even if this Court is concerned about the harsh results that a jurisdictional rule might impose, this is not that case because this is a case in which the jurisdictional rules are being applied neutrally, as they should, to an appropriate exercise of sovereign authority. It just happens to be that a different political party -- a different Attorney General of a different political party after an election would have exercised that authority differently. But that's always the case when a successor in office stands into the shoes of their predecessor."
