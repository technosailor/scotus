But what Congress did was put forth an easily administrable rule that says we look at what happened in the prior cases and were those prior cases dismissed for failure to state a claim, not looking at whether there was with prejudice or without prejudice. And this makes sense when you also look at the structure of the Act, because the structure of the Act says -- again, it uses failure to state a claim several times, and it says in the structure, several times, you, district court, have the authority and in some cases the obligation to screen cases and dismiss them if they fail to state a claim. And then, in 1915(g), it says: For those claims that were dismissed for failure to state a claim, those count as a strike."

We have a situation where we have an inmate in prison for a felony sexual assault who brought three actions during the period of 2013 and 2014, each of which was dismissed for failure to state a claim, which is one of the enumerated actions. And in Section 1915(g), the text of the statute says that if we have a -- a prisoner who, on three or more prior occasions while incarcerated, brought an action or an appeal in the courts of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, they are barred, they are subject to the three-strikes rule. So, as in the Coleman case, we have a situation where it is literally what the words of the statute say."

We think the same applies here in the particular context where you're dealing with what a court interprets a prior dismissal. And for that reason, we think the Coleman decision supports us because Coleman, in addition to relying on the plain language, relied on the ordinary background principles of Civil Rules of Procedure. And, here, the ordinary background rule is that, while Rule 12(b), an authorization provision, allows for a dismissal with or without prejudice, when you are determining the impact of -- of a dismissal after it has previously been entered, it is -- there's a conclusive presumption that it is with prejudice. So we think Congress would have understood it that way."

Another point I'd like to make is I didn't hear a good response to Justice Kavanaugh's question as to why there would be a good reason to treat differently actions that -- instances in which a court allows amendment and then dismisses versus instances in which the court decides, well, I'm just going to dismiss this entire action without prejudice. And the other side's argument seems to rely on the notion that courts will by and large apply Rule 15 and allow multiple amendments."

When you look at the screening provisions, in particular 1915(e) and 1997(e), they speak in terms of requiring the court to dismiss the action or the case. So the idea that they can cure the problem that their reading has by saying, well, courts are going to allow multiple amendments, so you don't have to worry about instances in which there is a without-prejudice dismissal, I don't think is consistent with how the -- the Act works as a whole. The final point I'd like to make is that the other side alluded multiple times to the -- how many prisoner suits there were and that they've decreased. As we noted in our reply brief, there's no indication that there is any different pattern in the Third or Fourth Circuit."
