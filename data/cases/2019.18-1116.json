  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2015, Christopher Sulyma, a former Intel employee and participant in the company\u2019s retirement plans filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly investing retirement funds in violation of Section 1104 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets forth the standard of care of fiduciaries. Sulyma alleged that the funds were not properly diversified and that as a result, they did not perform well during his employment (and thus investment) period of 2010 to 2012.</p>\n<p>Intel moved to dismiss the complaint as time-barred under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(2), which provides that an action under Section 1104 may not be commenced more than \u201cthree years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation.\u201d The district court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and ordered discovery for the question of the statute of limitations. After discovery, the district court found no genuine dispute as to any material fact that Sulyma had actual knowledge of the investments more than three years before filing the action, and it granted summary judgment for Intel. Sulyma appealed.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \u201cactual knowledge\u201d does not mean that the plaintiff knew that the underlying action violated ERISA or that the underlying action even occurred, only that the plaintiff was actually aware of the nature of the alleged breach. For a Section 1104 action, this means the plaintiff must have known that the defendant had acted and that those acts were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does the three-year statute of limitations period in ERISA, which runs \u201cfrom the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation\u201d\u2014bar a suit where the defendants disclosed all relevant information but the plaintiff chose not to read or could not recall having read the information?</p>\n",
