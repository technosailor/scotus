In fact, Powell said that the most obvious explanation for that kind of inconsistency is that jurors were convinced of guilt and decided to acquit out of lenity. And it would be particularly inappropriate, I think, to accord preclusive effect to that kind of verdict based on lenity, because it would essentially magnify the effects of the jury's nullification and extend it far beyond the compromise the jury itself struck and affect other counts beyond what the jury ever intended. And so I think Powell rightly recognized that when we're in a situation where we can't know that the jury was following its instructions and applying a lot of fact in a rational manner, then the defendant's not able to carry the burden to show that the acquittal is the verdict that -- that the jury truly meant and intended to resolve the factual disputes in the case.

And so I think Yeager itself emphasized that although we do have these finality concerns, a verdict of acquittal is final only with those issues that it actually decided, and Yeager was able to conclude that the jury in that case, through the acquittal, did decide issues in the defendant's favor as opposed to, for example, deciding to acquit out of compassion, exercise lenity, or neglect to follow instructions through the count of acquittal.
