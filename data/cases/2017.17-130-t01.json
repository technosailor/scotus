That's what that opinion held and it's been understood to be authoritative since then. That -- that's essentially the Office of Legal Counsel test from 2007. The second part of the test is really I think exactly what Mr. -- Mr. Wall said. There's always going to be a question of where the legal authority to act is, because otherwise every person with discretion like every AUSA is going to be considered an officer, even though the U.S. Attorney is going to be held 100 percent accountable for every decision in his or her office. I think the -- the first place where you can see that -- that relationship of, you know, basically agent to officer is Section 27 and 28 of the First Judiciary Act with the marshal and the deputy marshal. One of the things that under Section 28 the deputy marshal was authorized to do was, when the marshal died, to execute writs in the name of the deceased marshal until a new marshal was chosen. So the -- sort of the second part of our test, which asks whether somebody's authorized to act in the name of their own office or only in the name of somebody else's office, just reflects that principle, which I think is, as we've talked about, ubiquitous in actual government practice. It's why Assistants to the Solicitor General don't need to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate since I don't think there's a statute that actually authorizes the Attorney General to appoint them himself.
