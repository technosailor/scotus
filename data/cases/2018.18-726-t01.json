When state officials use redistricting to burden a particular group of voters because of their political views, with the express goal of making it harder for those -- for that group of voters to win elections, and when that goal is achieved so that group of voters is ordinarily doomed to usual electoral defeat under the map, and when the state cannot come forward with a legitimate governmental interest to justify the burdens imposed, the map has to be neutrally redrawn. That, in a nutshell, is our claim. And all of the evidence in our case proves that the 2011 redistricting in Maryland violated that theory."

What makes your case so easy is that everybody was completely upfront about what they were doing, as they were in the North Carolina case as well, because they think it's legal, so let's say what we're doing. But if we say it's not legal and that kind of intent evidence just disappears because you don't find silver bullets like that very often, then what kind of effects evidence would you need to prove your claim?"

And in 2010, the last election before the redistricting, Democrats across the country won 52 congressional seats in districts that were more Democratic than the Sixth District in Maryland. So what these legislators were looking at was not a map that was a lock for a future domination by Democrats in the Sixth District. It was a very vulnerable map, if you look at the results of the 2010 elections, where Republicans swept to victory in district after district with more Democratic components than the Sixth District. But the reason that this test doesn't work, as counsel revealed, is that it abandons what this Court or members of this Court, including Justice Kagan in her Gill concurrence, have identified as an essential evil of gerrymandering, which is the politicians getting one over on the people and not letting the people's will control what the map is going to be. In this case, the people's will was -- was expressed in a referendum overwhelmingly favoring the map."
