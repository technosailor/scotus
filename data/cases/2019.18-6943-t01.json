In those days, whether to entertain a second or successive petition was within the discretion of the district court. So how natural would it be for a district court in that situation, upon receiving a 59(e) motion, to say before I get to this discretionary question about whether I would entertain this if it was a second or successive petition, I have to decide whether it is something that has to be considered that or can be considered a Rule 59(e) motion. Wouldn't there be a natural tendency for the judge just to jump to the final question about whether the judge is going to entertain it in -- as -- as a discretionary matter?"

I think the flip side of that I do want to comment on is that we believe the other side's position is much -- going to be much more inefficient, sort of perversely, even though they argue that their approach is designed to streamline the -- the habeas review process, because, under their approach, any time a Rule 59(e) motion is filed, a judge cannot just look at it and say: I don't see anything here. Denied. Instead, the judge has to make a threshold inquiry to determine, is there something that constitutes a habeas claim within the meaning of Gonzalez? In some instances, that might be simple; in others, not so much. And after the court makes that determination, it then has to decide, well, suppose this is a mixed, you know, Rule 59(e) motion in the sense that it raises some things that are claims but some things that are not because it goes into the integrity of the federal proceeding."

And we think it would just be -- it's much more efficient for a court that has just ruled on a motion -- and, by its nature, a Rule 59(e) motion has to be filed immediately after the judgment -- to be able to review it and, if there's nothing there, deny it, and then the process can move forward with the certificate of appealability.

Their answer to both of those points is that, well, AEDPA specifically contemplates amended complaints and specifically contemplates petition for rehearing, but I take that just as an acknowledgment that their test is inconsistent with the structure of the statute, and they're having to develop ad hoc exceptions in order to -- to read them in.

Similarly, the Fifth Circuit takes the view that alleging a conflict of interest by habeas counsel would be attack on the integrity of the proceeding, even though this Court recognized in Gonzalez that merely arguing that appellate -- that habeas counsel missed an issue or failed to develop it would not be something that goes to the integrity of the proceeding.
