The third thing I would say is that what they're really asking for here, even if Apprendi applied, is a bespoke application of the Apprendi rule.

It aggravates the punishment in the sense that it -- where the original verdict allowed only a zero- to 10-year sentence that a judge could have imposed, to a mandatory five-year sentence, all the way up to life in prison. And I also think that Justice Gorsuch's comment that when -- if -- if the Sixth Amendment didn't apply, would this also apply if you had a -- if the sentence was a death penalty? And the potential life in prison without parole, which 3583(k) allows, is the second-most serious punishment that's allowed in the law. And those types of heightened punishments that 3583(k) allows create tremendous due process problems and they also create tremendous problems with regard to the right to a jury trial."
