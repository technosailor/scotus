Now, happily, I don't think we face that problem on a systematic basis today the way that we did during the Vietnam war, but, of course, that could change and a constitutional ruling by this Court would take this tool off the table forever. I also think there are individual cases like this one where employers -- you know, there's a good-faith dispute about whether there was a violation in this case, but being able to bring these suits is an important remedy for the individuals and it's an important deterrent effect for the employers, including state employers, to know that they have to comply with the statute or -- or else they'll face, you know, real consequences."

So I think that is powerful support, assuming the Court is going to continue to rely on Hamilton's account of sovereign immunity, to understand where there was a surrender of sovereign immunity in the Plan of the Convention and to find that these particular powers are subject to that surrender."

It -- it -- there's nothing for and about the notion of damages and -- and a waiver of state sovereign immunity and the same is true about suits by states against other states.

Regarding Katz and regarding there being sort of a uniquely federal interest there, there's a uniquely federal interest that this Court described when it was recalling Katz and Allen v. Cooper that sort of cited that there were these disparate state discharge orders and that, ultimately, individuals were being kept -- kept in debtors prisons as a consequence. And it looked at the Bankruptcy Act of 1800 and the potential for habeas relief there and sort of concluded by that ongoing history, contemporaneous with Chisholm, that the states had planned for federal courts to have a unique role to solve this problem among states, so -- so unique that, in fact, that clause itself disposed with any opportunity, any -- any sovereign immunity defense. Of course, this Court also described that as a \"good for one clause only\" holding, in part because it was recognizing that this Court had held, not just stated but held in Seminole Tribe that all other Article I, Section 8 powers wouldn't yield that result."

One of the problems in PennEast was that New Jersey, by refusing -- by -- by -- by refusing to cooperate in the policy decision that the United States had made with respect to national gas pipelines, was thwarting federal policy. And isn't it all the more serious here to have the states have the potential to thwart -- I mean, let's -- let's imagine that states decide -- let's say we get involved in Ukraine and states say that we shouldn't be, and so they use discrimination against veterans returning home to express their disapproval of our engagement."

Of course, stare decisis is a practical -- a sort of practical consideration and a practical doctrine, but this Court has said, and as recently as Allen v. Cooper repeated that no Article I, Section 8 power sort of dispenses with state sovereign immunity. To say that all of the powers that are reasonably described as war powers suddenly actually had no immunity to resist in the first place would be to, at best, minimize Seminole Tribe to virtually nothing. It surely occurred to this Court when it propounded that statement in Seminole Tribe and reconfirmed it in Alden that all of the powers in Article I, Section 8, including a number of powers that had a direct basis on war, including the Army clause, the Navy clause, the enclave clause and so on. So, at minimum, to the extent this Court were inclined to say something along the lines of this critical nature, this very -- this foundational nature of these powers means they are treated differently, it has to be prepared to disregard decades of precedent in sovereign immunity.

One would think the United States would sue California or -- or any other sort of obstreperous state and that, in fact, they would sue in sort of -- in the nature of class relief or equitable relief, prohibiting California and/or -- you know, and/or any of its officers from engaging in that flatly illegal policy, one would think that that either would be effective, or if it weren't, but if it weren't effective, then the court would face a constitutional crisis because a state is sort of deliberately disobeying federal court orders.

And, really, the Vietnam War is what made this statute necessary because it's the first time we see a state potentially taking action that's going to directly affect the military's power. But do you discount the 1830s history, where, as did Justice Gorsuch, with respect to the habeas power? And, there, courts were releasing federal military officers from state custody because they were needed for the war efforts at the time, and the courts and the states had absolutely no hesitation in saying that Congressional need superseded the states' need to -- to hold a prisoner in custody. That was an individual suit, not for money, I grant you, but you didn't need money there because all you needed was the person to be released. So I guess what I'm asking is you concede that the states knew that if they impeded the war effort they would be sued by the federal government at least."
