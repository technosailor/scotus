So I would like you to talk about this using the methodology of the Model Penal Code. So, if we look at -- at the elements, do you agree with me that the element that we're talking about here is that, as applied to a prosecution based on the content of communication, the content must -- must be such as to cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress, and the question is, what is the mens rea for that element? Are we together up to that point?"

But I guess I don't understand -- I mean, in the New York Times versus Sullivan context, intent does matter for the definition of defamation, but it's a unique context, right? So, here, I -- I understand why in the Elonis sense we would say that what separates culpable from not culpable conduct is the level of intent, and so that mattered in interpreting the mens rea requirements of that statute.

A lot of the examples you can come up with from the Bible Believers case, which was an incitement case, but \"Turn or Burn,\" imagine a protester speaking to a doctor going to an abortion clinic, \"Turn or Burn\" might be warning about damnation, might be, you know, \"we're going to bomb your clinic.\" There's a lot of speech on the internet that walks the line, you know, \"burn it all down,\" you know, \"come and take it,\" Second Amendment -- or Second Amendment remedies. There's a lot of speech online that -- that kind of comes close to the line, and it's not a matter of absolute clarity which way it would fall, and I think it protects that kind of speech, which, again, is virtually identical to the stuff that comes up in incitement cases.

And, again, for somebody saying, I wish you would die, he might get up there and say, oh, you know, I -- I thought it in the most benign way possible, but the question is, did you think that that would cause that person fear. And if they -- if they can say, oh, well, I emailed this person 20 times saying I wish that they would die, but I didn't mean for them to feel fear about it, the jury can draw the conclusion that most people would conclude -- that most people would draw that the guy is guilty as sin. Similarly, the favorite excuse of -- of regulators is that people could just get up and say, it's a joke, but if you emailed the Boston Marathon and say, I'm going to be Tsarnaev Part II, and then you don't get to just say, it was a joke, the question is, did he think you would cause harm or, in the government's standard, you know, did they disregard, consciously disregard, the risk that it would -- it would put people in fear.
