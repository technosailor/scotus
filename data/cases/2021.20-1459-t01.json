Second, as to attempted Hobbs Act robbery specifically, its elements, substantial step and specific intent, necessarily entail the use, attempted use, or at least threatened use of force that is required by the law of attempt, and it is borne out by the universe of real cases. The possible interpretations of the elements clause that could favor Respondent -- there are two -- are each unsound: either reducing the \"attempted use\" phrase to a near nullity or drawing an incoherent distinction between different attempt crimes that can be equally violent, like attempted murder and attempted robbery. And to make his theory work, Respondent would dramatically expand attempt liability."

And so, to the extent there were, although unidentified, you know, a crime -- some crimes in which the record seems to suggest something that would go beyond what this Court views as appropriate attempt liability, it is within this Court's power to say: Well, no, actually, the law of attempt does not stretch that far.

But then the penalty provision only provides penalties for uses of force, attempted uses of force, and threatened uses of force, which reflects, I think, the common-sense and textual intuition that there's no such thing as an attempted threat in the abstract that does not itself attempt the use of force or threaten the use of force."

Stokeling teaches us that is force, not to mention the fact that she might actually resist.

So a defendant who did all the things that these hypotheticals reflect has attempted to commit a crime, and oftentimes the only intent you can prove or the easiest intent to prove is that the defendant intended to threaten. So do defendants appeal and bring futile arguments that really there's no such thing as an attempt to threaten? I don't know why they would do that because the Hobbs Act is incredibly clear that it -- it prohibits robbery, as did the common law, by means of use of force or by means of fear. It's enough if the robber is successful in threatening and gets the property. And so, when the person goes to the store, all of these cases that come up on appeal are sustained by the government if the evidence shows or the defendant admits an intent to threaten."

That is what I mean to say, and to the extent I created confusion on that, I'm sorry. Second, as to the records reflecting prosecutions for non-threatening conduct, first, contrary to my friend, there is every incentive for a defendant to argue that he did not commit a substantial step sufficient to constitute an attempted Hobbs Act robbery. At the very least, there is always an incentive at sentencing for a defendant to make a record of the -- but -- of the fact that his crime involved only benign preparatory steps and that he never under any circumstances would even have yanked property from his victim's hand had she resisted for a moment.
