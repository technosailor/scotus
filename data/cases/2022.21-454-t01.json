And the Court said that it's not our place to second-guess the agency determination that in drawing the boundaries of waters, which is the central jurisdictional term, in drawing the boundaries of waters, it's not unreasonable that there may be some semi-aquatic features that are brought into that boundary."

And as I understand, the case really, as your brief set it out, comes down to, okay, what about a wetlands separated by a berm or dune or by a dike or levy? And on that question, I -- I suppose, since Congress hasn't specified that it goes that extra step, why not let Congress figure out where the line is? I mean, I think that's the toughest hurdle you face, is that Congress -- we've gotten, as Justice Alito, says from waters to adjacent and now from contiguous or neighboring to -- contiguous or bordering to also neighboring, and shouldn't that be Congress's job? So what's your general response to that?"

And we think, if you really had a case where there was someone who was being criminally prosecuted and had a claim that the statute was vague as applied to them, that they didn't have fair notice, they could always bring an as-applied vagueness challenge in the criminal prosecution."
