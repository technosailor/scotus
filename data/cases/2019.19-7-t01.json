The Court can provide complete relief by invalidating the Civil Investigative Demand and reversing the judgment below. In any event, the text and context of the Dodd-Frank Act make clear that Congress wanted to create an agency that was independent to the fullest extent possible and not to vest vast power in an agency that was subject to presidential control without any congressional control over its funding. The government's proposed remedy would have the perverse effect of making the CFPB less independent than agencies it was replacing. The Court should leave to Congress the quintessentially legislative task of deciding how to fix the CFPB's defective structure."

But I think, second, to the extent that we're talking about Congress's goal here, there is abundant evidence that what Congress was trying to do was to create an agency that precisely, because of its desire to protect consumers, was insulated from political control to the fullest extent possible. As Elizabeth Warren, who was really the progenitor of the CFPB, said at the time, if Congress did not create an agency with functional independence, \"my second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.\" And so, if this Court is considering what the hypothetical Congress -- what Congress would have hypothetically wanted at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act, I don't think that what Congress would have wanted was the creation of an agency that was fully subject to the President's control."

The first is that I think that the text of the boilerplate severability clause in the Dodd-Frank Act can be read to say, in essence, only that if you strike an invalid constitutional provision, the entirety of the remainder of the Act shall not fall. And part of the reason why you may want to give the boilerplate provision that interpretation is because of the more specific severability provision in Title V, which I think by the government's own concession would be rendered superfluous if you don't adopt our proposed meaning. But, if you disagree with me on that, I do have a second point, which is that this Court has consistently made clear the severability clauses create only a presumption. After all, they are, as this Court has indicated, an aid in determining the intent of a hypothetical Congress. And, here, I would respectfully submit that the presumption is a weak one because, on the one hand, you have a boilerplate severability clause which covers the entirety of the Dodd-Frank Act, and on the other hand, you have very specific indicia in Title X itself, the very --"

The second is multi-member commissions actually in my view represent less of a threat to liberty precisely because they are multi-member bodies that act through deliberation and consensus, and that restrains the exercise of their power. For a single-headed agency, often the only restraint on the exercise of power is a political or democratic accountability restraint."

And the key structural constraint at issue here is the one set forth in Article II, that the executive power shall be vested in a President and that he shall take care that the laws will be faithfully executed. The only way he can do that is if he's fully accountable for the decisions of his principal officers."

The President and the Executive Branch acting through the President does not want the CID dropped, which is why the acting director, when he was removable at will, ratified the investigatory demand here and told the Ninth Circuit that that ratification was an independent, non-constitutional basis to resolve the entire case. The Solicitor General, at page 22 of his reply brief, continues to argue that the ratification precludes any relief for the Petitioner."

On jurisdiction, amicus, who is appointed to defend the judgment below, now seems primarily to be arguing that this Court made a mistake in granting certiorari because of the existence of the ratification question. As a preliminary matter, that was flagged by both sides at the cert stage and this Court, nevertheless, granted review, and I would respectfully submit for good reason. Ratification goes at most to the remedy for the constitutional violation here. And that issue is obviously not briefed before this Court."

But notably, unlike in the other cases involving challenges to the CFPB's constitutionality, the government provided no factual support, no declaration, nothing in support of ratification. I think the ratification is deeply legally problematic here, too, and I would refer the Court to the amicus brief of RD Legal Funding if the Court has questions about that, and ratification wouldn't solve the constitutional problem because, even if the CID itself had been ratified, the continued prosecution of this enforcement action would still present exactly the same constitutional concern. Now, on the merits, amicus disparages the notion that the removal power is illimitable."

No one defends the rationale of Humphrey's Executor distinguishing between executive functions and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions. And our approach gives meaning to Humphrey's Executor and allows the Court to leave it in place by limiting it to the multi-member context. Amicus's proposed approach by contrast would really create an exception without limit. And the exception cannot be limited to cabinet officers because, for those cabinet officers who exercise enumerated constitutional responsibilities, that's only two, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. All 13 of the other cabinet officers as the cabinet is currently constituted would be removable."
