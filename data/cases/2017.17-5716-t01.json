The first is that for the very reason you stated, Justice Sotomayor, that there's such wide variance, sometimes not just between districts but between courtrooms in the same courthouse, it would be -- it would be in -- in contravention of the very principles of the Sentencing Reform Act, which say avoid sentencing disparities, to deny relief to some of those defendants and to give other defendants relief, just based on the happenstance of what judge that defendant happened to adhere -- appear in front of.

And I think that adds one other thing I want to say, and it brings me back to Justice Ginsburg's question about the concern about disparities and who gets relief and who doesn't. We think that our solution actually, for the reasons I just described, avoids sentencing disparities and also avoids sentencing disparities because we're asking for our sentences to be adjusted just as somebody would be sentenced today. As we point out in our briefing, though, the government is the one that creates the disparity problem because, under the government's view, people whose guideline ranges were above the minimum, and even if the judge sentenced below, those people are eligible for Section 3582 relief. And the only difference between those people and -- and our clients in this case is that the guidelines measured their crimes as being more serious than the ones our clients committed. And we think it would be highly irregular and, in fact, perverse for a court to say for the people who committed more serious offenses but are otherwise identically situated, we are going to grant them relief in sentences reductions, but not the people whose crimes weren't judged to be quite as serious. They are not even allowed to ask the judge to exercise discretion in their favor. So we think that would be a wild anomaly that this Court ought to construe Section 3582 to avoid.

The reason it couldn't work that way is, although the guidelines are not mandatory now, and we understand that is a constitutional ruling, Congress implemented this against the backdrop of guidelines it believed were mandatory.

They don't claim that the Commission could write a rule that says everyone who is sentenced to a 20-year statutory minimum under 21 U.S.C. 841 now gets a 10-year sentence. Instead, to the extent they're relying on the ability of the Commission or the judge to recommend or impose a sentence that is below the statutory minimum, they're relying on Section 3553(e).

And the reason why is because the judge adjusted the guideline sentences in our cases according to Subsection 5G1.1 and the Commission, as part of its amendments to 782 and the policy statements accompanying it, said when you calculate an amendment -- an amended guideline range, you do not include Section 5G1.1 as part of that calculation. So we have explained to the Court, and I don't think it's rebuttable, that even if you take the mistake the judge made in the first instance as a historical fact that the Court has to deal with, they still have lower guideline ranges under Section 3582.
