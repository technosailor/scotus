And, second, if a same-sex couple ever came to Catholic Social Services, Catholic Social Services would refer that couple to another agency that works with same-sex couples so that the couple could participate and be a foster -- foster parents. And then, third, no same-sex couple has ever come to Catholic Social Services for participation in this program, and, therefore, Catholic Social Services' policy has never actually denied any same-sex couple the opportunity to be foster parents in Philadelphia. I just want to make sure those three facts are accurate, and you can elaborate as you see fit."

The City refuses to place foster children in available foster homes certified by CSS simply because, if CSS were ever asked to certify a gay couple, it would respectfully decline and refer them to another foster agency. The City's draconian response to CSS's hypothetical position discriminates against religious exercise for two reasons. First, the City lacks a generally applicable rule because it seeks to apply a non-discrimination requirement to CSS despite having exempted comparable secular conduct, thereby devaluing CSS's religious concerns. Second, the City has not neutrally applied this rule because it has shown undue disrespect to CSS's sincere religious beliefs by pleading a win-win accommodation as too odious to tolerate."

And with respect to 3.21, Your Honor, it does two basic things. First, it says that it bars FCAs from rejecting a referral from DHS."

And the test that I would say governs this case, which is really quite narrow in this sense because it's a government contracting case, is the test the Court made -- laid out in NASA versus Nelson, where the Court asked whether it was a reasonable rule that the government was insisting for its contractors. And, actually, the Court in that case used the phrase \"internal operations.\" So all you have to do is put Nelson together with Lyng and Roy, which tell you that the Free Exercise Clause allows the government the same power when it deals with its internal operations."

And the government, as Justice Kagan said earlier, can take over certain operations. Indeed, the City, as Justice Sotomayor said, could do the certification itself. But also I want to answer, Justice Alito, in terms of the history, and I want to echo what my friend, Mr. Katyal, said, which is that, yes, the same term, \"foster care,\" is used that was used historically, but it's a completely different program now because the children are in city custody and we're talking about selecting people --"

Under Smith, particularly as applied by the courts below, government officials have no incentive to reach sensible accommodations, knowing they will be shielded by the flimsiest claim to have a generally applicable law. Our pluralistic society is at its best when it has a Free Exercise Clause that protects free exercise, not just of those who agree with the officials in charge. Thank you."
