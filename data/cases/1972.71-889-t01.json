Caplin, that these records are personal records and should be protected wherever they are, just as in the Fourth Amendment, I mean the Fourth Amendment search and seizure situation which we contend this falls under it too, because I think of necessity, of necessity documents that are subject to the Fifth Amendment privilege, any search and seizure by the government would be an unreasonable search and seizure.",
