There are two different strands, though, which I want to emphasize, both of which are associated with common -- with sovereign immunity, but they're important -- the rationales are slightly different.

And so, at a minimum, you're going to be addressing the question of how can a statute that refers to orders for constitutional violations that are clearly taking effect against the Board, how can you have that if there is not abrogation for constitutional violations? And I don't think there's any way to say that that happens without some sort of abrogation happening in PROMESA even under a clear statement rule. The other side has pointed to the Title 3 bankruptcy proceedings, and that is simply incorrect. That cannot be the answer to how there is abrogation for constitutional violations for two reasons. First of all, if Congress wanted to refer to Title 3 as the basis for these orders against constitutional violations, it presumably would have done what it did in Section 2126(a), which is to actually refer expressly to the carveout for Title 3, which has its own very reticulated judicial review scheme of its own. And second of all, there is no abrogation for the type of claims that the Board is pointing to here that would get you to an abrogation under Title 3 for orders remedying constitutional violations. Let me explain why."

The Board has pointed to cases in which it didn't actually raise immunity in the Title 3 context, and until now, the government seemed to have some discomfort with hanging the case on that ground. So just the PROMESA abrogation question I think is, at a minimum, very complicated and, if anything, tilts in our favor given that there is language even under a clear statement rule that you cannot explain under the other side's view unless there is some abrogation for constitutional violations of the type here. Again, it would be even more curious to think that PROMESA, while giving the Board lots of other powers in many other respects, sub silentio essentially overruled the Puerto Rico constitution and its structural waiver of immunity for all of the other parts of Puerto Rico's government and that that was not something that could be brought against the Board."

It would not help to DIG this case for the simple reason that there's a First Circuit ruling on the books right now which says that 2126 abrogates all kinds of actions, every possible action against the Board, both under federal law and under territorial law. That's an enormous decision. It's very counterintuitive to think Congress would have wanted that, that even situations where the Board or a -- or a governmental entity in Puerto Rico may have had immunity on its own if it were part of the territory, now when it's a suit against the Board in federal court, the Board has a target on its back."
