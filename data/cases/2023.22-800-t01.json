If the government's position in this case is right, then current law already requires taxpayers to report and pay tax on appreciation in the value of all their assets, on corporate earnings for any stocks that they own, and on any paper gains from their contracts and loans.

And so, if there is some reason to look beyond that and attribute income to the shareholder, that would necessarily raise a question of income and why it is that the shareholder isn't being taxed on what would otherwise be a property interest. So I think the Court has always addressed this sort of question as a question of income, and that includes, for example, all of the assignment-of-income cases that the Court has decided over the years."

I think, if there is a lesson to be drawn from Macomber, it's that there's a real danger in trying to -- to, as an abstract matter, define \"income\" for all purposes or to, you know, as -- as Glenshaw Glass said, to provide a touchstone for all future cases, in part because our experience with the Tax Code is that taxpayers often latch on to those statements and use it as a basis to try to avoid taxation going forward. So I don't think that the Court needs to approach this issue by adopting some global or universal definition of \"income.\" The Internal Revenue Code itself doesn't define \"income.\" Instead, it says that income is all income from whatever sources realized and then gives some illustrative examples. I don't think my friends are offering the Court a definition of \"income\" because they say income is realized gains or maybe some category of unrealized gains that you can say are constructively realized."

The reason why I would strongly caution the Court away from adopting a realization requirement is not only that we think that it is inaccurate, profoundly ahistorical, inconsistent with the text of the Sixteenth Amendment, but it would also wreak havoc on the proper operation of the Tax Code. I think that there are pass-through taxes that would withstand scrutiny if the Court affirms the attribution holding, but, as I had mentioned to Justice Barrett, there are a number of critically important provisions of the code that don't actually have that kind of pass-through mechanism and don't turn on realization at all. That includes the mark-to-market taxes, original issued discount on bonds that drives prices in bond markets and avoids what could otherwise be sheltering of income that should be taxable."

But I also think that it's important for the Court to not rely on concerns about those types of far-fetched hypotheticals to announce bright-line rules about what the Sixteenth Amendment requires that could actually take down critically important provisions of the Tax Code and that respond to real-life concerns and very legitimate exercises of the taxing power. In particular, many of the times when Congress has chosen to tax in the absence of realization, it's because taxpayers can abuse the rules."
