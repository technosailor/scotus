The Solicitor General agrees that all the objections actually raised by Petitioners to mootness are unfounded but suggests that the Court could proceed to the merits of the constitutional questions anyway because Petitioners might be -- in the future be able to add a new claim for damages that they have never asserted and still now only most reluctantly embrace. The Court has never adopted that kind of reasoning under Article III and it should not begin with this case. And the second implication of the case's framing is that if the case weren't moot, the only question presented on the merits would be whether a premises license must, as an adjunct thereto, include the implied transport rights sought by Petitioners. Though Petitioners now invoke a general right to bear arms outside the home, a premises license is not addressed to that purpose."

It's -- it's great when local governments respond to the constitutional constraints that are suggested by others in litigation. But it does seem a bit much, doesn't it, to fault plaintiffs for not having a specific damages requirement in their prayer for relief in a complaint that was framed years ago. This litigation, I think, has taken five-plus years, and that has become relevant only at this late stage after the city and the state have enacted a new law. Why isn't the prospect of allowing damages to be added to the complaint enough? In a 1983 action, damages are clearly available. The complaint, long ago as it was filed, did say that they sought all available relief, you know, typical prayer for relief."
