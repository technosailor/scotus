And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness. Now you had suggested that there's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal, and that's true, but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision, and so the HEROES Act isn't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute. I don't think anything can be read into the fact that there's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated."

And I think, if the Court were to just look at costs alone, it would take the major questions doctrine outside of that extraordinary case because national policies these days frequently do involve more substantial costs or trigger political controversy.

The first is that the whole point of incorporation is that you're creating a separate legal person with its own rights and interests. And Missouri has derived substantial benefits from structuring MOHELA that way. And the second is the basic Article III principle that a party has to come to court and assert her own rights and interests."

Now we take very seriously the idea of the separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse, and there are many procedural niceties that have to be followed for the same purpose. The case reminds me of the one we had a few years ago under a different administration where the administration tried acting on its own to cancel the Dreamers program, and we blocked that effort. And I just wonder, given the posture of the case and given our historic concern about the separation of powers, you would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious, important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that, significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered implicated?"

Of course, implementing this program doesn't require that any money be drawn from the Treasury, and so I don't think that it strictly raises an appropriations issue, which is why I think the states aren't raising that argument here. And to the extent that the concern is about the Secretary taking action in a way that Congress didn't authorize, it seems to me that it just collapses back into the central interpretive question in this case, which is does the HEROES Act authorize the Secretary's action or not. With respect to the concern you raised that the -- the effect of loan forgiveness here will result in cancellation of a measure of debt for the affected borrowers, of course, that's true, but I don't think that that is materially different from the kind of effects you can see from other types of authority that's long been exercised under the HEROES Act. You know, take the forbearance policy that I mentioned."

So, once we're in the world where it's clear under the statute that the Secretary isn't violating the HEROES Act by providing relief that's class-wide and may have the effect of offering critical benefits to borrowers who, as it turns out, wouldn't have needed them in the absence of the relief, then I think the question boils down to has the Secretary justified his line-drawing and the scope of relief, and that really should function under arbitrary and capricious review. And, here, I think, with respect to all of the states' arguments, they lack merit when you look at the Secretary's explanation for why this relief, in his judgment, was necessary. He documented the substantial economic impacts of the COVID pandemic across the entire country that's already necessitated unprecedented levels of aid that we've never seen before, $5 trillion in other pandemic relief efforts, this forbearance policy under the HEROES Act that the Department had never put into place before. So he documented those financial effects the pandemic has had on borrowers, and then he explained, using data that he examined, that huge swaths, substantial percentages of borrowers were going to be at serious risk of default and delinquency or inability to pay their loans once forbearance ends. And that ultimately justified his decision about how to craft the limits within the program and the scope of relief to offer. And I think that all of the states' arguments about how that wasn't strictly necessary or that maybe it doesn't have enough of a connection to the pandemic are answered in full by the Secretary's analysis here."

You know, when you've got a government program that is -- as the Court has said before, constitutes extravagant regulatory authority, that takes an identifiable group of individuals or entities and directly imposes burdens or costs on them. And I think there is a distinction with the benefit context when it comes to how Congress is likely to legislate and its general comfort level with broadly empowering the executive to provide benefits to Americans, especially in the context of an emergency situation. But even if you didn't think that that benefits and regulation distinction should carry the day and be a bright-line rule, at the very least, I think it should factor into the analysis when applying interpretive principles here and in looking at what Congress is -- is doing. And as I mentioned before and -- and would love to finish here, you know, think about what Congress is supposed to do."

But I think it would be particularly anomalous in this case to accept any of the states' attenuated theories of standing because there isn't even a situation where there's no other identifiable plaintiff or possibility to have the -- the courts weigh in on these issues.

And what concerns me is that to the extent you're talking about separation of powers and major questions, the judiciary is part of the same constitutional separation of powers dynamic that compels us to think about questions like the major questions doctrine.
