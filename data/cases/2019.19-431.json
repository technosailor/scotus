  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Women\u2019s Health Amendment to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that women's health insurance include coverage for preventive health care, including contraception. The rule provided that a nonprofit religious employer who objects to providing contraceptive services may file an accommodation form requesting an exemption to the requirement, thereby avoiding paying for or otherwise participating in the provision of contraception to its employees.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-354\"><em>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</em>, 573 U.S. 682 (2014)</a>, the Supreme Court held that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), closely-held for-profit corporations were also entitled to invoke the exemption if they had sincere religious objections to the provision of contraceptive coverage. Then, in <em>Wheaton College v. Burwell</em>, 573 U.S. 958, (2014), the Court held that an entity seeking an exemption did not need to file the accommodation form; rather, its notification to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was sufficient to receive the exemption. HHS and the Departments of Labor and Treasury promulgated a final rule in compliance with these rulings.</p>\n<p>Then, in <a><em>Zubik v. Burwell</em>, 578 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, the Court considered another challenge the rule, which asserted that merely submitting the accommodation notice \u201csubstantially burden[ed] the exercise of their religion,\u201d in violation of RFRA. In a per curiam opinion, the Court declined to reach the merits of that question.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration promulgated regulations that greatly expanded the entities eligible to claim an exemption to the requirement that group health insurance plans cover contraceptive services. The new rules, which the agencies promulgated without issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking or soliciting public comment, expanded the scope of the religious exemption and added a \u201cmoral\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the rules in federal district court, alleging that they violate the Constitution, federal anti-discrimination law, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After a hearing and reviewing evidence, the district court issued a nationwide injunction enjoining the rules\u2019 enforcement, finding the states were likely to succeed on their APA claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p>This case is consolidated with a similar case,\u00a0<em>Trump v. Pennsylvania</em>, No. 19-454, presenting the same legal question.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>1. Does the petitioner in this case have judicial standing?</p>\n<p>2. Did the federal government lawfully exempt religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage?</p>\n",
