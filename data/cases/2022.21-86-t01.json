Nonetheless, the government insists that the grant of additional jurisdiction to the courts of appeals over orders not at issue here impliedly precludes jurisdiction that Congress expressly conferred. That argument does not follow from any explicit statutory text, and the three factors that this Court has fashioned to decide the reach of implied preclusion all favor district court jurisdiction here, just as in Free Enterprise Fund. First, any review mechanism that delays judicial review of a here-and-now constitutional injury until it has come and went does not provide meaningful review."

You have other arguments in your brief, the -- you know, sometimes you call them the plain text arguments or just about the way 1331 and the review provisions interact, which would seem to go much further, would seem to sweep in not just constitutional claims but statutory claims and would seem to sweep in many preliminary rulings, you know, like real -- you know, truly, truly interlocutory rulings of the kind -- you know, it might be evidentiary rulings, it might be discovery rulings.

So, if I were a law professor, I might quibble that these factors that the Court has come up with for jurisdiction really should go to non-jurisdictional factors and these cases should be resolved on B-6 rather than B-1, but I'm not a law professor."

I think that in a situation in which you have the type of claim, maybe some of your removal claims with respect to the ALJ, for example, if the remedy is just give us a new ALJ, then there's the -- there's a concern that what is happening by allowing citizens to go to the district court is that they're sort of superintending the agency process, whereas you could say -- and, therefore, you could say it's not wholly collateral in the same way as if you went over and the remedy was to terminate the agency process.

If I could say one thing about why I think, in addition to the existential nature of the kind of removal claim, why that's such a strong case is, if you sort of think about, like, the theory for why it is that, like, a challenge to kind of early agency action doesn't go to federal court, it must be, I think, on the theory that, well, until it gets to the Article III court, there's at least supervision by the Article II branch that provides the citizen with some protection of their liberty. So, if your whole claim is that the Article II supervision being provided by the President is insufficient, then you're really saying I don't have any protection the whole time this stays before the executive branch. And that really does seem like a claim that almost uniquely belongs in district court, and then it gets resolved one way or another."

And imagine for a second that this sentence appeared as the second sentence of the FTC Act review provision and you had the first sentence with words to the effect that a person who receives a cease-and-desist order may file a petition for review in the court of appeals, and then the second sentence said preliminary steps taken during the adjudication shall be reviewed on review of the final agency action.

And this Court invoked MedImmune, which, in turn, summarizes a long line of this Court's decisions that say we really strain to provide judicial review that is not contingent on committing a violation and subjecting yourself to penalties. And the Court in Standard Oil addressed this point where the Court was explaining why the requirement to participate in the adjudication itself was different from what was at issue in Abbott Labs.

I think the Thunder Basin perhaps could have been written even more vigorously if it said certain things that we are treating as implications are, in fact, buttressed by the text of the APA. And so, for instance, the Court has said repeatedly when Congress provides for a comprehensive and specific review mechanism governing a particular class of agency conduct, we will often infer from that detail and specificity that it is intended to be exclusive and that review through an alternative district court mechanism is unavailable. And so what we intended to be an important point in our brief was that is not just an inference."

And so, again, the APA actually says, if there is a special statutory review mechanism and if it is not inadequate, then you have to use that."

It may -- whether the due process challenge succeeds may be unrelated to the merits of any particular allegation that a regulated party has violated the FTC Act, but it's still -- it is still not collateral to the review provisions because it goes to the way in which the administrative adjudication will be conducted. And -- and, here, we have basically the same thing, that -- oh -- oh, the challenge to the removal protections for the FTC Commissioners is a little bit different because the FTC does a lot of other things. If the Commission issued a rule, then the rule could be challenged on the ground that the Commissioners were unlawfully protected from removal."

The -- the corollary point I would make, in FTC versus Standard Oil, the Court said we don't anticipate that the agency in the course of the administrative proceedings will reconsider its original determination that there was reason to believe a violation had occurred.

And on the back end, we think, for all the reasons we've talked about, we're not in this jurisdictional trap because we're not really challenging the agency action. Now, on the difference between the APA factors and the Thunder Basin factors, I mean, I was quite surprised when the government was asked about its argument under the Thunder Basin factors that it seemed to really want to talk about the APA instead, and I sort of took from the whole colloquy that the government's view is that the Thunder Basin factors are kind of a bad gloss or an inadequate gloss on where the APA would get you. And maybe, you know, that starts to make me think that maybe the straightforward way of approaching this is right if I kind of thought the best thing you could say about the Thunder Basin factors is they sort of get you where you would get with the APA anyway, so it's kind of no harm, no foul, but if even the government thinks that that's not the right gloss on the APA, maybe we should just stick with the text. Now that brings us to the Thunder Basin factors."

Lastly, on the issue of meaningful relief, I mean, as to the removal claims in particular, I mean, with all due respect to this Court, if you look at what the splintered decisions in the Collins case, when it came to relief for this kind of removal action, when it's retrospective, that seems like a particularly good reason to allow prospective relief and say, look, if an agency is unconstitutionally structured, we shouldn't have to go in there prospectively."

The government's response is you might be able to review that question in October '23 if and only if the government decides to file a cert petition. From the perspective of those subject to this unconstitutional action, that's not good enough."
