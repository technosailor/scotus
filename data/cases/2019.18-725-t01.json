The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied."

The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252."

So the question in this case boils down to whether the government has put forward a sufficient case for holding that the words \"inadmissible\" and \"removable\" in the stop-time rule mean something different from what it concedes they mean in these adjacent or nearby statutes addressing the same subject matter. And I don't think the government has put forward that case, because I think that many of the contextual clues that apply in the nearby statutes also apply in the stop-time rule, or at least there isn't a sufficient reason for construing those statutes differently. So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the stop-time rule is applied only in the context of removal proceedings after the immigration judge has just decided whether an alien is inadmissible or removable."

Maybe it's conceded, but there's some kind of adjudication that the alien is, in fact, inadmissible or removable. And then the next step, the immigration judge is asked to decide, does this offense render the alien inadmissible or removable? I just think it's natural to talk about what just happened, rather than this new proceeding that imagines what would have happened if the person had left and tried to come back.

So the way I -- I look at that is that the first part of that referred to in 1182, that's the category of crimes that's capable of stopping the clock. And then there's the second part of the statute, which has what we see as, okay, not only does it have to be on this list of crimes, that's the first part, but it has to have this particular type of consequence, which is rendering you inadmissible or -- or removable. And, in fact, that leads to an argument we make about -- about surplusage, that it makes more sense to view the statute that way than the government's way because, under the government's position, at least until it filed its brief in this case, it conceded that the removable portion of the statute was total surplusage."

So Congress did not think there was some sort of disjunct between saying an alien was already admitted and yet he's inadmissible. It wrote the statute in exactly that way.

So you go to the stop-time rule, which, after all, is just like a buried definitional provision in the cancellation of removal statute itself, and you have \"inadmissible\" or \"removable.\" And the natural inference is that the reason those are there is that those are the two things that can happen.
