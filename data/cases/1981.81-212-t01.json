I would like to leave the Court just with this last point... we don't think there is any due process problem in the Part B hearing appeal system, obviously, but if the Court disagrees, if they think, for example, as the Plaintiffs allege, that there is too close a connection between the carrier and the hearing officer, then it seems to us that the proper remedy is simply to ask the Secretary to take a closer look and pre-screen who are selected as hearing officers, and not to judicially legislate and superimpose an entire ALJ system on top of the Part B hearing system.",
