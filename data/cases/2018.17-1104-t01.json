There's no question here that the Navy knew about the dangers of asbestos and that, over time, asbestos manufacturers knew about the dangers of asbestos and, again, companies came up with alternatives. So the policy rationale here is to place the burden on the party that has the ability to control the harm, and, moreover, the asbestos component manufacturers are the ones that are in the best position to warn. If we had put some sort of a plate on our equipment, first, who knows if it would have been seen down the road as opposed to the package of new insulation that has to be opened and applied. And, second, as technology changes, our warning from 1945 might well have become outdated and inconsistent with a state-of-the-art warning provided later. And so that's why tort law puts the liability on the party that actually has the ability to control the harm."

Does the manufacturer need to do that? Has it directed the use of batteries?

What happens here is you have two pieces of metal -- that's why it's called the bare-metal defense -- and in between them is a gasket, just like a washer in something in your house, okay? This thing cannot operate unless it's sealed with something that has a little bit more flexibility to it, and that's why you have a gasket and that's why -- the reason it's asbestos is it's the only thing in the relevant period of time that would work. And so, in that situation when you, the manufacturer, are designing your machine and knowing what kind of gasket will I be able to use, it's going to have to be an asbestos one, but not just that, I know that when you break the machine open, right, to do maintenance on the machine, we have to get inside it, I know you're going to have to scrape that off and make it perfectly clean in order to reseal it, given the tolerances of my machine."

Moreover, if you look at our system, while the system as a whole generates heat, not all equipment in the system even does that. The -- the turbine, for example, spins around but isn't generating any appreciable amount of heat. And so the idea that every manufacturer in this integrated system is liable for warning would just -- would, again, lead to over-warning and excessive liability. With respect to the cases that Mr. Goldstein cited, the Huynh case is one in which the grinder caused the wheel to explode because the particular wheel was incompatible with the grinder. And so, in that situation, there, of course, might well be a duty on the part of the grinder manufacturer to say: Don't use this wheel. The Macias case did not involve later added components."
