It doesn't -- it doesn't describe any particular topic, unlike the law in Reed, which differentiated between ideological signs, which could be of one dimension and one duration, political signs, which could be of another dimension and another duration, and event signs related to charitable meetings and religious meetings. There, you have a jurisdiction singling out different kinds of speech and creating a hierarchy of values among those topics, and that resembles what was going on in Sorrell, where the Court said you're distinguishing on who can get pharmaceutical-related information based on the speaker to whom you're providing it.

And this Court held in 1981 in the Metromedia opinion, which was fractured, but reduces to the proposition that a jurisdiction can decide to have on-site, on-premises commercial advertising and to totally eliminate billboards, billboards being the quintessential example of off-site advertising. And when the City of Austin denied the application for signage transformation into digital signage, it specifically said you are a non-conforming billboard because of your off-premises commercial speech, and that was the basis for the denial. That basis infringes no First Amendment right under this Court's decision in Metromedia that was reaffirmed later both in the Taxpayers for Vincent case and the City of Ladue case."

So, if I understand it correctly, if it's content-based, you agree that strict scrutiny applies and you are not making an argument that you could prevail on strict scrutiny, presumably, because you don't think you have a sufficiently compelling interest under this Court's precedents. But, if it's content neutral, you say intermediate scrutiny applies and that you win because you have a sufficiently important or significant government interest, even though not compelling."

And if the Court is trying to decide do we need strict scrutiny here when we have a law of the generality of off-premises/on-premises, its pedigree and its acceptance in this Court's decisions under intermediate scrutiny for 50, 60 years now, without a vanishing of ideas and the vibrancy and flourishing of signage, should give the Court some comfort that it's on the right track if it reads Reed exactly for what Reed said. When you have specific subject matter that's targeted, you're in content-based land, and, therefore, you go to strict scrutiny."

And so, if -- if you want to think about how to sort of recognize that as a -- a -- a separate category that we're not going to treat as content-based without watering down strict scrutiny, I think the sorts of interests that the Court looked to in City of Renton in terms of deciding that a law that, you know, you could plausibly say was content-based on its face would nevertheless be treated as content-neutral.

There was disagreement in that case about whether the -- the way the particular requirement was framed reflected viewpoint discrimination because it was only certain people who could speak within the scope of their employment, but I at least don't see any disagreement in the opinions there about the principle that a generally applicable law about speaking within the scope of employment would not be content-based."

That distinction turns on the subject matter, function, and purpose of the content of the messages on the signs, and it has the effect of prioritizing certain messages from certain speakers and limiting, if not prohibiting, others. The fact that Austin's regulation does not prohibit speech on an entire subject and that the application of the regulation depends on a factor in addition to the sign's content does not render it content-neutral."

Now I would note, as I noted at the outset, that even under intermediate scrutiny, we believe that we should prevail because there's simply no fit here between the regulation at issue and the distinction, whether it's the distinction between on-premises and off-premises signs or any differential treatment of commercial speech and Austin's asserted interests. But we ultimately think that strict scrutiny should apply across the board here for the simple reason that Austin's regulation does not in any way disaggregate commercial from non-commercial speech, and that's particularly true with regard to the speech that is being limited here, which is the speech that my client would display on its digital signs. Now we don't even know what that speech is for the simple reason that my client has not yet leased out its signs, and at any given time, the parties that would lease those signs would presumably change. But I think that the critical point here is that the regulation in no way draws a distinction between commercial and non-commercial speech, and, again, the real focus here should be on the speech that is being limited. And this case is no different from the Riley case that we cite in that regard."

Again, it's -- it's very nice to sort of discuss the definition of on-premises and off-premises signs in isolation, but, of course, the real question is, what restrictions or regulations flow from that definition? And the analysis for a law like the Highway Beautification Act, which permits on-premises signs but prohibits off-premises signs, is, I would submit, potentially different from the analysis on the digitization ban. What makes this such an odd case is that Austin permitted a small number of off-premises signs to remain and yet forbade the owners of those signs from doing what the owners of thousands of signs in Austin have been permitted to do, which is to convert them to digital signs, which enables the owners of those signs to display many more messages and to do that much more efficiently. With regard to what Austin did, Justice Gorsuch, I would just add one further thing, which is that in 2017, it is true that Austin permitted the display of non-commercial signs, but Austin did not materially modify the definition of off-premises signs, which is the trigger for the digitization ban at issue here. And so I think that the parties are in agreement that even under the post-2017 regulatory regime, we would not be permitted to convert our signs to digital signs."

Metromedia itself involved an outright prohibition on off-premises signs, and I would submit that the analysis there could be different because the fit between the interests that are asserted and the regulation at issue could be analyzed in a different way. And so, in our view, all that the Court needs to do here is to say, as Justice Kagan suggested in her concurring opinion in Reed, that this digitization ban does not survive either strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny if the Court doesn't want to provide guidance on the question of whether on-premises/off-premises distinctions are subject to strict scrutiny across the board. And, in our view, because of the examples that we have given, I think that it is clear that an on-premises/off-premises distinction that turns on whether or not a sign advertises on-premises or off-premises activities is a paradigmatic example of a regulation that distinguishes between different types of communicative content. We've talked about the example of a church that is limited in the speech that it can display on a sign on its premises, but I think many of the other examples that we have discussed today really drive home the extent to which this is a distinction based on content. We talked about the example involving Franklin's Barbecue."

The question is whether we should treat a trigger of religious speech or political speech or speech by Republicans or speech by Democrats or all the kinds of triggers that we understand to be dangerous and -- and -- and that we understand to be content-based as we have always used that label, whether that trigger should be treated in the exact identical way as the trigger in this law, which is, does it advertise off-premises activities?

But, in some sense, the whole point of the framework that this Court established in Reed -- and I don't think it was inconsistent with this Court's past precedents -- was a framework that looked first to the face of the regulation and, only after that, to the purpose of the regulation. And the Court made clear that even in cases where it might seem as if a regulation is benign or reasonable, the Court still has to take that first step and determine whether or not the distinction is content-based on its face. And as I indicated to Justice Gorsuch, I do think that there is a sense in which a regulation like this is distortive."

That is true, but the really fundamental question is, would a sign like that be advertising a person not at the premises? I think the answer to that is yes, but that would be a matter for Austin's sign regulators to decide, and I think that really drives home why this requires not just an examination of content but particularly a close examination of content to determine whether or not it is regulated."

Now, substantively, we've talked a lot this morning about how strict scrutiny is the highest rung of review that the -- the Court applies and that applying it where it is not warranted runs the risk of dismantling a host of reasonable signage regulation by jurisdictions.
