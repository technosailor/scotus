Instead, the settled understanding for the last 45 years has been that ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes, even though ANCs are not and have never been federally recognized Indian Tribes. That interpretation has been endorsed by all three branches of the federal government. Congress was acting against the backdrop of those settled understandings when it incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020."

Now I think, in context, one would naturally understand that the final clause in that, the clause referring to jobs requiring frequent -- frequent contact with the public, really only modifies and in context can only be understood to modify the doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who appear in the list at the beginning. And then there's just an including clause stuck in the middle there, in perhaps not the most elegant place, but in a place that makes clear that the intent is to expand that category of, you know, front-line workers to also include their families and minor children. And that's what Congress did in the ISDA definition."

Second, I just want to emphasize again that the question presented here arises under the CARES Act, which Congress enacted in 2020, and by that time, there can be no real question that the ISDA definition was uniformly understood to include ANCs, even though they are not federally recognized Indian Tribes. That was the administrative construction, it was the Ninth Circuit's construction in the Cook Inlet case, the construction articulated in all of the leading treatises in this area."

But, if that clause is only given its ordinary meaning, ANCs plainly satisfy it. Congress said \"recognized as eligible,\" not \"recognized as sovereigns,\" and ANCs have long been recognized as eligible for special federal Indian benefits starting with the Settlement Act. If, instead, the phrase is given a term-of-art meaning restricted to sovereign tribes, then it is wholly inapplicable to entities established by Congress as alternatives to sovereign tribes. Either reading is vastly preferable to one that would defeat the ANCs' specific inclusion in the definition."

But, to the extent entities have a status, nobody doubts that ANCs have a native status, and I think the fact that the real point of the Self-Determination Act is to take natives who are eligible for special federal Indian benefits and instead of having the federal government provide those directly, you have a tribal entity do that. And in Alaska, the ANCs have been doing that for 45 years, and it's been working exceptionally well."

Now I think the government's absurdity -- absurdity argument has more force because, in 45 years, not a one -- if we accept what the D.C. Circuit said, that in 1974 it was uncertain whether some would be recognized politically, it's clear now it's not going to be.

And neither the court of appeals nor Respondents have ever identified any evidence that Congress was at any time uncertain about the sovereign status of ANCs. And there's textual evidence in ISDA to that effect."

Certainly, there was no doubt about that point in 2020 when Congress enacted the CARES Act and incorporated into it the ISDA definition. And as I think Justice Alito's perceptive questions have pointed out, I mean, it makes no sense to think that the CARES Act incorporated for a -- purposes of a one-time distribution of funds, the CARES Act incorporated a definition under which ANCs would be included only if at some theoretical point in the future Congress chooses to fundamentally reinvent the concept of recognition and recognize as eligible for government-to-government relations these private corporations. Now the second point I want to address is the CARES Act language about the definition of a tribal government."

For the lower 48 states, the paradigm is acknowledgment by the federal government. But, for ANCs, Congress has already deemed them to be eligible by including them in this special Alaska clause in the ISDA definition. And then, finally, on the practicalities, I mean, many thousands of Alaska natives are not enrolled members of a federally recognized Indian Tribe, and that's by design and that's how Congress set it up in ANCSA. And a decision finding that ANCs are ineligible to receive these CARES Act funds and potentially ineligible to participate in the many other federal programs that rely on the same language as the ISDA definition would have serious, serious consequences for the delivery of federal services and benefits to Alaska natives."
