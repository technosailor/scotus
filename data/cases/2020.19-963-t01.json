Respondent primarily focuses not on the question presented but on another question, whether the incorporation of arbitration rules that authorize the arbitrator to resolve questions of arbitrability constitutes a valid delegation. But the Court correctly declined to add that question at the certiorari stage because 12 circuits have held without conflict that the incorporation of arbitration rules is sufficient."

As you rightly point out, this Court has repeatedly said that Section 2 of the Arbitration Act, along with other sections, establishes the principle that arbitration agreements should be enforced according to their terms. But I think this Court has also recognized the presumption in favor of arbitration as flowing from the policy underlying the Arbitration Act as a whole. And that presumption, in turn, to pick up where Justice Breyer left off, seems to come from the labor context, where, of course, under federal law, you have the -- the Labor Arbitration Act, and you have in that Act, in the NLRA, a -- a -- a recognition that federal courts can recognize federal common law. So I think, if I were pressed, I would say it's probably ultimately a matter of federal common law, but it also appears to flow from the terms in the -- and -- and the structure of the statutes themselves."

Let's say that we're not going to address the question on which we denied cert, which is, you know, whether reference to the AAA rules suffices to be that clear and unmistakable arbitrability -- delegation of arbitrability. Here, as you point out, this carveout, you -- you say that it would be nonsensical -- even though parties can do it because they can contract and agree to what they want to, that it would be nonsense -- nonsensical to carve up arbitrability questions. If that's true, why isn't that reason to interpret this clause as not being a clear and unmistakable delegation of all questions of arbitrability?

Instead, Respondent is really asking the Court to decide this case based on a different question, the incorporation question. And that would be a bold strategy in any case, but I would submit it's a particularly bold strategy here because Respondent asked the Court to decide that question at the cert stage, and the Court seemingly consciously made the decision not to add it. Now that question in our view doesn't warrant the Court's review and it doesn't warrant the Court addressing it here in light of the overwhelming consensus of the lower courts on that question. But, if the Court were to reach that question anyway and to reject the consensus view, it would have dramatic consequences for innumerable commercial contracts that are worded much like the contracts here. All that the Court need do in this case is to hold that the court of appeals' actual reasoning is inconsistent with this Court's decisions applying familiar Federal Arbitration Act principles, and for that reason, the court of appeals' judgment should be vacated."

Just say that the agreement applies to all labor disputes within the factory, and there's a storage facility right next door where they keep things that are used in the factory, but they also keep other stuff, and the union says we want to arbitrate a dispute about that building, and the factory owner comes in and says, no, no, that's not within the arbitration agreement, that's not part of the fact -- of the factory.

So I do think that you can say, in theory, Rule 7(a) -- again, we disagree with this, but it's a delegation provision despite not having exclusive language and precluding the court from addressing it, and you can still say that just as parties adopt the same linguistic formulation when they want to delegate or not delegate or before Rule 7(a) even existed, the bare use of this, you know, boilerplate is not enough to show that the parties had any intention whatsoever to delegate."

And if it is ambiguous that a carveout applies to the delegation, a court should hold that it does not, especially given how unlikely it is that the parties would divide up responsibility in that fashion. The purpose of delegation provisions is to assign clear responsibility where there is a dispute about the scope of an arbitration agreement."

It would effectively defeat a delegation to accept Respondent's view because someone would have to decide when there is a dispute about whether the arbitrator or the court should decide arbitrability. And it's one thing to say that parties may want to divide up responsibility for different types of questions of arbitrability, such as who is subject to the arbitration agreement or whether a class action waiver is valid, but, as I pointed out in my earlier colloquy with Justice Kavanaugh, we are not aware of any actual agreement in the real world that divides up responsibility for a particular question of arbitrability and in particular the paramount question of the scope of the arbitration agreement. Justice Kagan, we are decidedly not asking the Court to recognize a third presumption here."

And that is because, in the words of this Court's decision in Rent-A-Center, \"an agreement to arbitrate a gateway issue is simply an additional antecedent agreement,\" and the FAA operates on that additional arbitration agreement just as it does in any other. In closing, all we're asking the Court to do today is what the Court ordinarily does, to resolve a circuit conflict on the question presented and to correct the legal error on the part of the court of appeals. Having held that there was a valid delegation, the court of appeals failed to apply the presumption of arbitrability to the delegation agreement."
