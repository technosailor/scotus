You know, from our first days, Chief Justice Marshall told Thomas Jefferson that he could be subpoenaed, he could be examined as a witness, he could be required to produce papers. And so I guess going back to Justice Breyer's question, why isn't the way to deal with these two things, that the President is special but that the President is like an ordinary citizen in that he's subject to law, is to say the President can make these usual objections that a subpoena recipient can make about harassment or about burden, and the courts in reviewing those, of course, should take seriously the President's objections and treat those with a certain kind of sensitivity and respect due to somebody who is a branch of government. Why isn't that the right way to do it?"

Instead, the burden is on the witness to show that the subpoena can have no conceivable relevance to any plausible subject of an investigation. Now that is a perfectly appropriate standard in the ordinary case, but the reason why Nixon applied the special needs standard above and beyond the ordinary rules of criminal procedure was because the Court recognized that the President is the sole person in whom all Article II powers are vested. And so he is entitled to a measure of protection above and beyond the ordinary rules. And the special needs standard is one of those measures of protection. To put -- point back to Justice Breyer's very persuasive concurrence in Clinton against Jones, I think Justice Breyer correctly predicted that this Court would need to develop special protective procedures precisely for the President in the context of litigation like this."

I think that in order to have meaningful judicial review, you would need -- the prosecutor would need to make public as much as could responsibly be made public so that the President would have an opportunity and the President's lawyers would have an opportunity to make their case on the particular facts. If there is a certain amount of evidence that really cannot responsibly be made public, then I think it would be appropriate to consider ex parte proceedings or filings under seal. In all events, we think that that's the type of assessment that needs to be made when you're talking about subpoenas, unprecedented subpoenas like this one, that are from state and local prosecutors targeting the President of the United States. The other place I would point you to is, again, Judge Wall's -- Wald's very good opinion for the D.C. Circuit in the In Re Sealed Case, where she does walk through in some amount of detail and unpack how the special needs standard applies to grand jury subpoenas."

So why are we using all that transplanted language, and why don't we get to a standard that takes care of what you're worried about, which is harassment and interference, and simply ask whether the investigation is based on credible suspicion of criminal activity and whether the subpoena is reasonably calculated to advance that investigation, a standard that looks to whether there is a good-faith basis for the state prosecutor's actions and whether the subpoena is reasonable in its scope and burdens? I don't understand why that sort of standard is inadequate, especially for a proceeding that involves secrecy, like a grand jury subpoena."

And that necessarily means that others can't unnecessary hobble or debilitate that person in his ability to responsibly carry out his duties. So the whole point of the special needs standard is to ensure that others, including prosecutors, can't unnecessarily impede the President in carrying out his responsibilities. So, at a minimum, they have to show that they really need the information that they're seeking, since, if you have 2300 prosecutors that are unnecessarily hitting the President with subpoenas and none of them can actually show they really need that information, you're necessarily going to be undermining the President's ability to effectively carry out the Article II duties that the Constitution entrusts to him and to him alone on behalf of the entire country."

Finally, his novel claim also asks the Court to presume that state actors have a \"reckless mania\" that will cause them to \"relentlessly harass presidents and that state and federal courts will allow prosecutors to do so.\" Of course, there's no historical support for this claim, which flies in the face of federalism."

So, again, we agree there -- there should be a heightened showing requirement, but my point is only after a president has already established an actual Article II burden. Otherwise, there's nothing for a court to weigh in the balancing of Article II interests against the need for legal process, which -- and that balancing and that sequencing, frankly, was both -- central in both the Nixon and Clinton cases.

We think language like that would be more consistent with past cases of this Court and with the realities of a grand jury investigation. And, frankly, the courts below also already found that we've met that standard here. The -- the problem is that the alternative of requiring a state prosecutor to get permission first from a federal judge for any request relating to a president's business activities would undermine this Court's prior rulings, like the one in R Enterprises that a grand jury shouldn't be burdened by procedural challenges and delays because it's a confidential process and not an adversarial proceeding."

If I might, the second big problem I think with the DOJ's analysis is that the language that they've chosen just doesn't work, contrary to why as to what I just set out, because it only applies in the context of a trial subpoena. It calls for a \"stringent showing\" that the request is \"directly relevant to central issues at trial and charging decisions.\" Again, that language just doesn't apply in the context of a grand jury when no charging decisions have been made. So that's why the -- the formulation that we've suggested, I think, would be more consistent with what's needed in a grand jury context."

Third, I -- I think, as -- as -- as, Justice Ginsburg, you mentioned in the last argument, this view that people -- that the -- there's a reckless mania by local prosecutors contradicts this Court's long-standing presumption in favor of regularity and deference to state proceedings. And so, to finish off, the limitation, I think, that you're asking about really comes in the -- in the form of the case-specific showing that past cases from this Court have established, because, if there is a concern about the behavior of a local prosecutor, any president, when necessary, but it's been few and far between over the decades, can run now not just into state court, which Clinton thought could be problematic, but can run into federal court and raise exactly the kind of claim that the President has raised here."

But even if that were to be addressed somehow, the risk of -- you know, over time by waiting, of losing evidence and losing witnesses and that kind of thing is a very real risk. Again, I think the OLC Moss memo addressed that expressly in -- in saying that a grand jury proceeding should be allowed to proceed. But, secondly, here -- and it's not unusual -- since there are other third-parties at issue in the investigation, requiring us to delay because a president is still in office as to those third-parties in -- in gathering important evidence could yield them being above the law if the statute of limitations runs as to them."
