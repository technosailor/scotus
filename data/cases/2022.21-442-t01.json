I'm not sure what that rule would do in the mine-run of cases, because I think that anytime you have multiple opinions, whether it's multiple trial court opinions or an opinion from a trial court, opinion from the Court of Criminal Appeals, the -- the litigants and the courts would be expected to compare the different opinions and say when was I supposed to know the way that the Court of Criminal Appeals or the way that the state high court was going to ultimately resolve this, either, you know, the first issuance of the opinion or on denial of rehearing?

Every statute of limitations is on some level a statute of repose that gives someone who is exposed to potential tort claims or other claims definition as to when they no longer have to be on -- essentially preparing for litigation for those things. Now the flip side of that is an accrual rule typically marks when an individual may first bring suit."

And in the case of Article 64, the full run of the procedure includes the trial court and then the direct appeal, in a capital case, the direct appeal to the CCA, and then we can have this dispute about whether the petition for rehearing is included or not. But I don't understand why he could exit at the trial court stage because the way Article 64 is set up, to ensure that he's not deprived of a constitutional right erroneously, is to give him the opportunity to appeal to the CCA and let the CCA correct any mistake that the trial court has made. So am I understanding that correctly? I just don't understand how the cause of action exists until the procedures have failed him."

I guess what I'm worried about is the suggestion that the accrual date necessarily has to start from a moment in which you can identify an injury such as you have in this case when, in cases like McDonough and Manuel, the Court seems to suggest that the accrual date is set in light of other considerations, including the fact that in this case you would have parallel litigation if you set the accrual date early. In this case, it doesn't seem to make any difference in terms of helping the state because the litigation in the state court is going on, so it's not like they don't have notice that the person is interested in litigating this claim."

And as to Mr. Reed, what I would say is that it's my understanding that you do not get a stay of execution just because you brought an Article 64 proceeding or just because you're in Section 1983 proceedings before a federal court challenging the adequacy of the procedures available to you from the state. Mr. Reed has a stay of execution from the Texas courts on his ninth subsequent habeas petition before the courts where he raised evidence that Fennell admitted to killing Stites because he discovered she was sleeping with a black man, that Fennell threatened to kill Stites if he caught her cheating, that Fennell made inculpatory statements at Stites' funeral and that Fennell and Stites' relationship was fraught."
