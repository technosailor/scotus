Because if you take a look at page 49 of Petitioner's brief, they argue that we would fall within the assignee exclusion, which refers to a -- a person who receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default, solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another. To reach even a situation in which an entity is collecting a debt for itself, their argument as to why we would fall within that exclusion is that we would be standing in the shoes of the originator; and, therefore, when we are collecting the debt for ourselves, we are collecting the debt for another, in other words, for an entity other than the originator.
