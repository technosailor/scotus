Had the Petitioner pursued a standalone claim for the rights -- for violation of the public-trial right, even though it was forfeited in Massachusetts, it would have gotten a review because all claims are reviewed in Massachusetts, just under a different standard. And, in fact, if -- looking at the way that Massachusetts has treated those standalone claims versus ineffectiveness claims, it's clear that Massachusetts understands what this Court said in -- in Kimmelman. Because in one case, in a case called Celester, the Commonwealth, via the SJC, was applying its substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard to an ineffectiveness claim based on this kind of a closure. And it -- and it cited -- it quoted Strickland. But in another case where it was focusing on the underlying right, it talked about public-trial theory, even as it applied the same standard of review.",
