We think the text, when read in light of the Dictionary Act, is amenable to that reading. But, if you took the opposite reading, you could have four, five, six proceedings with multiple remands, coming up to this Court perhaps, there's no way you can get more than 100 percent of past-due benefits if there are five proceedings. So that anomaly suggests that our reading of a 25 percent aggregate cap for the judicial proceedings is what was intended by Congress in 406(b), which would then suggest that normally, although there's not always -- it's not always the case because sometimes agency fees can exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits, normally, it should not exceed 50 percent, and in many cases, where the courts -- where you've got a lot of benefits, as the Court recognized in Gisbrecht, the reasonableness criterion allows courts to police for windfall --"

It's a piecemeal statute that was enacted over a series of amendments over a course of 50 years. But the best interpretation of its provisions, one that the agency has adopted and -- and argued in favor of in the courts for half a century, up until April of this year, is that it imposes a 25 percent aggregate cap on agency and court fees. There are three primary reasons why this is the best interpretation of the statute. First, it is the most plausible reading."

And it is one, second, which the agency agreed with and devised a framework for the payment of fees and the representation of claimants in the -- before the agency and before the court. And they created this framework with, as its most notable feature, this one 25 percent cap, which would make little sense if there was not an aggregate 25 percent cap on fees."

First, you would, if you got -- if you had a disability and SSI claim, you had to determine past-due benefits by first backing out, reducing it by the amount of the SSI before you determined the attorney fee. And the reason they were doing that is they were saying that the person ended up really not needing the SSI, they were made effectively poor by the fact that we weren't paying them the disability originally. So when we're -- going to determine attorneys' fees, we're going to reduce the amount of the past-due benefit pool to be paid from."

We ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand for further proceedings."
