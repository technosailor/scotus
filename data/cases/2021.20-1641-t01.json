The Sixth Circuit has determined that there also is an implied mandate that dialysis providers occupy a specific position to be determined relative to providers who serve other vital healthcare needs of the 157 million American people who depend upon group health plans to defray the costs of their healthcare.

Patients right now who are -- who are paying on a -- on a allowable cost basis with a reference-based price to in particular the Medicare price here, they're paying a much lower rate, their actual out-of-pocket. There's a specter of balance billing, but the important thing to remember about that is that that's a function -- the only thing that we can do in my -- that the Petitioners can do to avoid balance billing is to pay the full undiscounted charge because then, at that point, there -- there's no bill left over. We could pay -- we could pay 750 percent of the Medicare rate and there -- there would still be a balance billing, but it's -- it's -- that is something that is exclusively within the control of Respondents. And unless the Medicare Secondary Payer Act is going to be construed as something that -- that makes it -- gives a compulsory duty to group health plans to do everything they can to stop dialysis providers from inflicting the harm they can inflict through balance billing, which I don't think is a result that Congress ever contemplated or would bring us here, they're going to be -- they're going to be in a -- in a very precarious position --"

The -- the other point that Petitioners and their amici have made is that because the Medicare secondary payer statute itself does not require that group health plans provide coverage for renal dialysis, a decision in Respondents' favor might mean that more group health plans choose not to cover dialysis at all if -- if, you know, the result of covering it would be exposing them to liability under the statute.

And that's because, as -- as I think Justice Kagan's question suggested, Congress understood at the time that other proxies for ESRD might exist or more likely might come to exist with medical advances. And so the statute also prohibits differentiation on any other manner, which, in context, should be understood to mean in any other manner that in effect singles out a treatment for ESRD. I want to clarify just a couple of, I think, errors that my friend on the other side made."

He has said in his brief and today here that the government is quite troubled by what this plan is trying to do and it acknowledges that there very likely will be an adverse financial effect on the Medicare fisc if the Court reverses and adopts the -- the reading of the statute that -- that Judge Murphy provided in dissent below. But here -- here is -- and I -- I -- I apologize if I was wrangling with you, but I was objecting to your suggestion, which I know you don't mean, but I had heard it mistakenly, that the only people who are harmed here are possibly the Medicare fisc and my company or the companies. The harm here -- and this is -- this is probably laid out as well as anywhere by the amicus brief of the dialysis patients coalition, which is three -- 30,000 dialysis ESRD sufferers, who explain all the ways in which the provisions of this plan harm people. Now it -- you can say that, you know, this is just a payment dispute, but it's not. The core benefit that these plans provide is payment for medical services.
