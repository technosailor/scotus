Number two, if there's any ambiguity on this point, OPM's notice-and-comment regulation answers a question in favor of preemption. And number three, although the majority of the Supreme Court of Missouri thought otherwise, we believe there's no constitutional infirmity in Section 8902(m)(1) under the Supremacy Clause. If I could turn to my first point, it seems to us that the antisubrogation rule in this case is preempted for basically the same reasons this Court considered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was preempted under ERISA.",

In addition to those reasons, this statute gives you an additional reason to find that it is preempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules that relate to payments with respect to benefits. It is quite clear to us that the subrogation and reimbursement claims that are at issue in these rules quite plainly refer to and relate to payments with respect to benefits; and therefore, the Supreme Court of Missouri was wrong in overlooking that part of the statute and also wrong in overlooking your decision in FMC v. Holliday.",

So what I was getting at, and the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question, is that we would clearly get deference here on -- on 8902(d) in determining what are -- what are the definitions and are there limitations on benefits available under a plan? And I think under Chevron, it doesn't make much sense for us to get less deference in determining what is the nature and extent of benefits and benefit payments, if it's really just another way of saying the same thing. So, on -- on why it's important -- I think I covered this a little before -- but to be very concrete about this, in the D.C. metro region, Virginia prohibits subrogation, but Maryland and the District of Columbia do not.",

I'd like, if I can, to just turn to Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts' question that he posed to the challengers about the very odd nature of this express-preemption clause, because I do think it raises some very serious constitutional problems that -- that if -- if this Court were to adopt the challengers' interpretation, would -- would allow these contract terms to really do the displacing of State law. And I do think that there is -- it would be unprecedented -- Congress has never enacted another form of this type of preemption that would actually authorize the terms of privately-negotiated contracts to step in and displace otherwise applicable sovereign decisions of States. And there really is no way around this problem in the case, other than to adopt a narrow interpretation of what the -- what relates to benefits means, because Congress, when it wrote this statute in 1978, unambiguously intended to delegate the power to preempt to these terms of contracts.",

And then five years later, it amended that law and it delegated the power to preempt not to terms of a contract, but to regulations promulgated by a Federal agency; there, the Secretary of Defense. And I think if we're thinking about the democratically accountable ways that preemption should work and the protections that States must have for their own law, allowing either Congress to do the preempting or delegating that power specifically and expressly to an agency are the only two ways that we can -- that are -- that are constitutionally permissible, and here we have neither. Congress itself does not control the terms of these contracts, and it has not expressly delegated any authority to the agency to pronounce on preemption.
