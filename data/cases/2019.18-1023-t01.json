I think the reason that even Justice Scalia, no fan of the implied cause of action, was able to recognize that is because, if you think about the kind of obligations that are at issue in the jurisdiction over the Tucker Act, they are all clear obligations to pay, and whether it's the Takings Clause, whether it's a contract, whether it's a money-mandating statute."

But, of course, that would be subject to a subsequent Congress's amendment as well. So, for purposes of the retroactivity argument, I think what's important here is, in 2010, they made a money-mandating promise that I think anyone who looked at all the sources would say, that's good enough. Now could it be better? Could it have belt and suspenders? Sure, but it's good enough."

But, if an insurance company is watching Congress and what it sees is there are express efforts to repeal this provision expressly going forward and they fail, and all there is is an effort by some people to essentially hobble the Secretary of Health and Human Services in her ability to discharge what have to be understood as obligations of the United States, then, under those circumstances, the right result is to file a suit and get your judgment and get your claim from the Judgment Fund. But it is not the law that the government can simply make its obligations go away by deciding that, after the fact, after the obligations have been incurred, after the counterparty has been -- has performed, we're just not going to appropriate the money."

I think, if you actually think about that opinion and read the key footnotes, which are 31, 38, 42, and 48 -- I think I have that right -- if you look at that, I don't think there's any indication that if what was at issue there is something like this, which is an entirely retrospective set of obligations for a program that essentially sunsetted in 2016, I don't think there's any indication that the Court would have thought that should be brought as an APA action and not as a Tucker Act claim.
