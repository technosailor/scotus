As much as the District would like to change the subject, the record is clear that Coach Kennedy was fired for that midfield prayer, not for any earlier practices."

And so -- and -- and, again, the concerns -- the reason it gets back to government speech at least in my view is because one technique that the Ninth Circuit used to approve this is one of these excessively broad job descriptions.
