Delaware has used that freedom to create a system unique among the states of constitutionally-mandated political balance for its judiciary, with the result that Delaware's courts are widely regarded as the least partisan and most professional in the nation. The Third Circuit has upended that system based on an implausible reading of this Court's political patronage cases."

But even if we're wrong about that, the Delaware provisions serve a compelling interest in creating a uniquely balanced and nonpartisan judiciary. Now, to make matters worse, the Third Circuit invalidated the bare majority provision based solely on severability, despite having found that Mr. Adams has no standing to challenge that requirement. That analysis directly conflicts with both federal and state severability doctrines. There is no doubt whatsoever that the bare majority requirement can stand on its own."

I mean, take Mr. Adams as a great example of this because he professes to be -- after having been a life-long Democrat, he professes to be a Bernie Sanders Independent. So, if there were already a democratic majority on the Court and the governor were able to name Mr. Adams, it would just fly in the face and frustrate the purposes of the political balance provision."
