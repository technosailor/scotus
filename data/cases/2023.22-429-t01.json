And so the fact that, you know, someone can say: Well, my website has, you know, the same information for all comers and she wasn't sort of personally picked out to have different information, I think is no answer to the idea that this is real discrimination under the ADA. And I think this -- that's a concept that this Court has recognized in other areas. So, for example, in the religion context, obviously, in cases like Abercrombie, the Court has made clear that, you know, it's not enough to just have a neutral no head covering policy. You need to make an accommodation to treat people equally. To the gamesmanship point, I think that our test for standing will be narrower than the one that the court of appeals adopted. I think there will be fewer testers. I don't think there will be no testers, and I think that's just a -- a consequence of the fact that this statute does provide a -- a right to anyone who's trying to use the service, and we don't take a step back and look to their motive. But I do think, to some of the questions that came earlier, the -- the lower courts will have ways to ferret some of that gamesmanship out."

As Congress recognized, when places of public accommodation fail to take reasonable steps to make their services available to people with disabilities, they signal that disabled people are unwelcome participants in the marketplace and contribute to their day-to-day experience of being isolated, invisible, and ignored. If the Court reaches the standing question presented by Acheson, it should reject Acheson's argument that a disabled person does not experience that dignitary harm when she encounters the accessibility barrier on Acheson's website, unless she also has travel plans that are thwarted by the discriminatory treatment. For over six decades and most notably in Havens Realty, this Court has recognized that discrimination inflicts Article III injury regardless of whether the plaintiff experiences any harm beyond the unequal treatment. What it means to personally experience discrimination on the internet is a novel question, but whether the answer is the one we've offered or the one the government proposes, Havens requires a test that focuses on what the plaintiff experiences on the website, not her underlying motive in that experience or whether any downstream injuries result. Finally, I want to return to the issue the Court started with today."

These circumstances render the case, at minimum, a poor vehicle for reaching the standing question. I welcome the Court's questions."

On the mootness issue, I just think that in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to decide the question presented, the Court should think about what's going to happen in the lower courts if it doesn't do that. So, first of all, in the Fourth Circuit, where Ms. Laufer's lawsuit -- or the decision finding standing is binding precedent, it's essentially going to be impossible or almost impossible for a hotel to ever challenge standing because, in the district court, the hotel would have to lose a motion to dismiss, litigate the case all the way to judgment, lose, appeal, lose based on binding circuit precedent, and then file a petition for rehearing en banc or a cert petition, and, of course, if that happens, then the hotel will abandon the case and cite this case for the proposition that it's allowed to do that."

In other circuits, like the First and the Eleventh Circuit, okay, if the Court Munsingwear's this case, it's going to be persuasive rather than binding precedent, but, of course, persuasive authority may prove influential to the district courts. And even assuming that courts ignore it altogether, then you're going to have every single district court deciding this standing question in the first instance, which is going to lead to a lot of judicial resources being expended that would be saved if this case currently before the Court is decided. So I think that if the Court is concerned about expending judicial resources, they would ultimately be saved at the end of the day if the Court decides the question presented. On the merits, just one word."
