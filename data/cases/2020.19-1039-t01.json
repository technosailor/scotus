So that's one reason I think of it more as deputizing rather than delegating. But the other reason is what I alluded to with the Chief Justice, which is it seems to me that when a private party does exercise the eminent-domain authority, it is a limited-purpose federal actor for purposes of the Takings Clause, and by parity of reasoning, it seems like it is also a federal actor for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment."

But is that a fair inference? Is it a -- is it a sufficient inference? Would it not have been entirely reasonable for a state to think, look, okay, we understand we're giving up our sovereign immunity against a condemnation suit by the United States, but we don't think that we necessarily are giving up our sovereign immunity with respect to a condemnation suit by a delegee, even though this is a rule that applies in other contexts?"

The cases that you cite, like immovable property cases, like Georgia versus Chattanooga, all kind of rely on inference.

As a matter of fact, it look longer for the federal government to assert an original jurisdiction action against the state than it took the federal government to exercise its federal eminent-domain authority in the states. By -- by my count, the first original action against a state was against -- U.S. against North Carolina in 1890. But, in both cases, even though it took 70 to 100 years for the federal government to exercise the power, the courts still looked and said, okay, going back to the framing, we understand that the Supremacy Clause, which is part, obviously, of the Plan of the Convention, has certain implications, and one implication that is here is that once New Jersey concedes, as it does and I think it must, that the federal government has the eminent-domain authority over this property, then no sovereign ever has had an immunity defense against the taking of property pursuant to the eminent-domain authority by the superior sovereign without respect to whether it's been delegated."

So, at pages 168, 175, and 235 of the record, there's considerable evidence that PennEast's actual route might change, and FERC itself instructed the company to consider a change of the final two miles of the route and it -- as part of the future permitting stage and as the process unfolds. But PennEast went and sought eminent domain along the entire original route, which is something that we think the United States would be less likely to do relative to our sovereign land when all of this process is still ongoing."

Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing?

And I think what that shows is that there's plenty of reasons why pipelines might not get built having nothing to do with sovereign immunity, but that uncertainty does exist in the industry, which is one of the reasons why we were so nervous about condemnations even before the permitting process had finished. But, to take your point on the statutory question for a moment, it's also notable that other times that Congress has spoken to the issue, it has understood that sometimes it wanted the statutes to include state land and sometimes it didn't and sometimes it excluded them, which, if it was true that every industry going through state lands was going to need this power, well, then it would be very strange to see those inclusion -- exclusions."

Now it's not true vis-\u00e0-vis other states and the United States because, as we know in international law as well, it's always looked different for sovereign-on-sovereign sort of litigation, in part because of their responsibility and control and in part because that's never been understood to offend sovereignty.
