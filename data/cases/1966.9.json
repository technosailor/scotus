  "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a 6-1 decision written by Justice Abraham Fortas, the Court held that Sealy’s licensing structure was a horizontal restraint of trade, a per se violation of the Sherman Act. He noted that the licensees controlled the day-to-day business of Sealy through the board of directors and the executive committee, including the grant, assignment, reassignment, and termination of exclusive territorial licenses. Justice Fortas held that Sealy’s behavior was an aggregation of trade restraints, reasoning that Sealy’s territorial restraints were a part of its admittedly unlawful price fixing scheme. While acknowledging that the territorial limitations served other purposes, he reasoned that their connection to price fixing was enough to require they be condemned as an unlawful restraint of trade.</p>\n<p>Justice John Harlan dissented. He argued that Sealy’s territorial licensing structure was a vertical arrangement not prohibited by the Sherman Act. He described the main purpose of Sealy’s licensing structure as the proper exploitation of the Sealy name and trademarks by licensed bedding manufacturers. Justice Harlan argued that the territorial restrictions were secondary or ancillary to that purpose. He rejected the majority’s theory that Sealy’s actions were an aggregation of trade restraints, noting that the district court did not address the reasonableness of Sealy’s territorial arrangements.</p>\n<p>Justices Tom Clark and Byron White took no part in the decision of the case.</p>\n",
  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Until about 1920, the Sealy Mattress Company was the sole manufacturer of Sealy products at its four factories in the Midwest and Southwest. By 1923, however, some 19 independent factories operated under Sealy licenses. Soon thereafter, these licensees and new owner E. E. Edwards formed the Sealy Corporation. Sealy continued to license the use of the Sealy mark to independent stock-holding bedding manufacturers.</p>\n<p>In 1925, the licensees agreed on a system of allocating exclusive territories to market Sealy products. Each manufacturer had an exclusive territory in his license contract; this contract prohibited each manufacturer from selling outside of that territory. Around this time, the licensee-stockholders and Sealy began collaborating to fix and police the minimum and maximum prices charged by retailers of Sealy products, the advertised prices of Sealy products, and the means of inducing retailers to adhere to these prices. In 1933, Sealy Corporation reorganized into Sealy, Incorporated. Sealy, Inc. made a new provision that any new manufacturers coming into the organization must purchase Sealy stock. In the 1940’s, Sealy’s business increased and many new licensees joined to cover previously open territories.</p>\n<p>The Sherman Act provided that every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce was illegal. The United States brought a civil action against Sealy, Inc. charging that it violated the Sherman Act by setting minimum retail prices and by forcing retailers to adhere to those prices. It also alleged that Sealy, Inc.’s exclusive territorial arrangements violated the Sherman Act. The district court held that Sealy, Inc.’s price fixing violated the Sherman Act, but that its territorial arrangements did not. The United States appealed the district court’s ruling on the legality of Sealy, Inc.’s licensing structure.</p>\n",
