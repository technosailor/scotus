                "text": "But, unlike the automatic stay, the turnover provision does not operate as an injunction or mandate the payment of damages if property is not immediately turned over. The turnover provision contains a number of statutory exceptions and defenses. For example, a creditor is not required to turn over an asset if the debtor cannot provide adequate protection for the creditor's interest in the asset. A creditor that contends in good faith that an asset is not subject to turnover is entitled to judicial process to resolve that dispute without owing damages if the debtor ultimately repairs. Respondents' contrary argument fails for multiple reasons. First, reading the automatic stay to require turnover contravenes the ordinary meaning of the term \"stay,\" which is status quo preserving. Second, it would render the actual turnover provision superfluous and would nullify the statutory exceptions and defenses to turnover. Finally, no one contends that the automatic stay imposed a turnover duty before the 1984 amendment that added the words \"exercise control.\" Reading that amendment to the automatic stay to effect a sea change in turnover practice violates this Court's repeated admonition that changes to the Bankruptcy Code should not be read to disrupt established practice absent an indication that Congress so intended."

We think it follows a fortiori, if a statute that -- that has injunctive language can't be punished with contempt or damages where there's fair ground of doubt, then it must follow that 542 also isn't -- isn't punishable by contempt where there is fair ground of doubt. Now, if there's not fair ground of doubt, if there's just bad-faith conduct where someone says, I know 542 requires me to turn this over to you, I just don't feel like it, come and get me, whether sanctions could be awarded in that case raises a different and harder question not presented here. But there is no question that that is all about the scope of 542."

But, similarly, in Section 362(a)(1), a creditor is required to stop any collection action in a judicial or administrative proceeding from going forward, and that requires that creditor to take action to stop things like garnishments.

First, Justice Gorsuch asked both of my friends about the role of 362(a)(6) and whether any of these actions are prohibited as prohibited debt collection activity. I think it's important to bear in mind, as this Court's opinion in Whiting Pools explains, that the Bankruptcy Code strikes a careful balance between the rights of secured creditors on the one hand and the rights of debtors to marshal the assets of the estate on the other and provides specific rights and protections to secured creditors. And where a secured creditor is seeking to vindicate those rights by holding the property in order to maximize its recovery as a secured creditor, whether that's through adequate protection or the treatment of its claim under a plan, while, in ordinary English, one might call that debt collection activity, that isn't prohibited by (a)(6)."

None of that has any home in the actual text of the statute and makes clear that their reading of Section 362 can't be correct.
