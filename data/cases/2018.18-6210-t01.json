But, to go to your point, it is -- it's an atypical type of consent because it has to be, because we are only and exclusively dealing with intoxicated people. So the normal, what I would call the typical at-the-scene consent that you might expect in other circumstances simply can't work in this context because we are only dealing with intoxicated people.
