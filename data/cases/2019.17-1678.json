  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Sergio Adri\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00fcereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national, was playing with friends in the cement culvert between El Paso, Texas, and Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr. arrived on the scene and detained one of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s friends on U.S. territory. Hern\u00e1ndez ran into Mexican territory and stood by a pillar near the culvert. From U.S. territory, Mesa fired at least two shots across the border at Hern\u00e1ndez, one of which struck Hern\u00e1ndez in the face and killed him.</p>\n<p>Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s parents filed a lawsuit against the officer and various other defendants alleging violation of their son\u2019s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and part and reversed in part. The Fifth Circuit held that Hern\u00e1ndez lacked Fourth Amendment rights, but his parents were entitled to a remedy under <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/301\"><em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents</em>, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)</a> (holding an implied cause of action against federal government officials who have violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights), and the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity. On rehearing en banc, the full Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the parents\u2019 claims, holding that they had failed to state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not \u201cclearly established\u201d that it was unconstitutional for an officer on U.S. soil to shoot a Mexican national on Mexican soil.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2016 and reversed the en banc Fifth Circuit as to qualified immunity. The Court remanded the case so the lower court could determine whether the shooting violated Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and whether his parents could assert claims for damages under <em>Bivens</em>. On remand, the en banc Fifth Circuit once again affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, holding that the excessive force claim was unlike any that had been decided previously and thus the plaintiffs were not entitled to any remedy under <em>Bivens</em>. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit applied the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-1358\"><em>Ziglar v. Abbasi</em>, 582 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, in which the Court held that for a new type of claim to be cognizable under <em>Bivens</em>, there must be some special factor makes the judiciary better suited than the legislature to recognize such a claim.\u00a0</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Should federal courts recognize a damages claim under <em>Bivens</em> if plaintiffs plausibly allege that a rogue federal law enforcement officer violated clearly established Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for which there is no alternative legal remedy?</p>\n",
