Of course, that's the -- that's how many U.S. persons are removed from the No Fly List, just based on the administrative redress process, which is what we think is happening. So ACLU documents that, well, some of these plaintiffs are removed before any briefs are filed, and then some are removed after the briefs are filed but before a district court decision."

I strongly dispute any notion that we're engaged in strategic mooting, and we have filed declarations from people occupying the same position as Courtright, not in this case but in follow-on cases, that say we never place someone on the No Fly List or remove them from the No Fly List because of litigation concerns.
