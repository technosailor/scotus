And it's not at all clear that a statute that was directed not just at calls but also, in particular, at artificial or prerecorded voice calls is really sensibly applied to texts at all. And if one were to hold that the statute were limited to actual voice calls and not to texts, that would be an alternative route for ruling in our favor in this case. The one other thing I would -- I would point to, Justice Thomas, is there is an amicus brief by the Washington Legal Foundation that addresses this issue specifically, and what they point out is that in more recent statutes, when Congress is -- when Congress addresses calls and texts, they do so either conjunctively or disjunctively."

I think the basic problem also inhered in technology that was prevalent in 1991, like speed dialing or call forwarding, which involves the rudimentary capacities to store numbers and to dial them. And the FCC confronted that issue in the immediate wake of the statute's passage in a 1992 rulemaking, and it said, don't worry about speed dialing, don't worry about call forwarding, that's not covered because it doesn't use a random or sequential number generator. So I think there's a -- you know, for the entire history of the TCPA, there's been the potential for it to be read way too broadly, and I think, since the very beginning, the sensible way to avoid that outcome is to read \"using a random or sequential number generator\" to modify both \"to store\" and \"to produce.\""

Obviously, when we're formulating our argument, it's hard for us to ignore the comma, which is part of the reason we didn't press the fourth construction. The other reason we didn't press it, to -- to -- to be candid, is if you don't think there's anything terribly anomalous about talking about calling using a random or sequential number generator, then I don't know why you think there's something so anomalous about storing numbers using a random or sequential number generator. I think, in both contexts, it's not the generator itself that does the calling or the storing, but in both cases, the number generator is used as part of the storage process or part of the calling process."

The Court -- the second prong of the statute doesn't include the word \"automatic.\" And I think it's an open question as to whether that's the right way to read this statute.

And I don't think it's unnatural to describe the latter system as using the random or sequential number generator to store the numbers in the same way that you might say that I have a backup power generator at my home that both generates and stores power for subsequent access or in the way you might say I -- you might describe using a web browser to download and store a file, that is to say, doing something more than just browsing the web.

And you, in your colloquy with the Chief Justice, suggested that although the FCC, you know, may have a narrow band of authority, you weren't ruling that out either. And I guess I'm wondering if you could explain why you think any kind of Chevron deference would apply here, where we have two conflicting choices and we have to decide which is the best one, because I would have thought that Chevron -- that the premise of it is that when Congress deliberately chooses open-ended language or vague language, it's implicitly delegated to the agency a range of discretion to make the choice. But this kind of thorny statutory provision doesn't strike me as reflecting an implicit congressional choice to delegate to the FCC how to regulate this."
