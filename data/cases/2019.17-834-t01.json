It is nearly nonsensical to think that Congress on the one hand would have created a specific crime for W-4 fraud and yet precluded its application in situations in which the W-4 is most commonly submitted, together with the I-9. It must be that Congress did not consider the umbrella of immunity as to the I-9 to extend so far as to hit the W-4, and, of course, Congress certainly didn't consider the immunity it was granting with respect to the I-9 to the extent it did to extend to the state tax withholding form, the K-4."

With respect to Justice Alito's line of questioning on the (b)(5) language, (b)(5) is certainly, if read as a preemption provision, most unusual, at -- not least of which is because it is not aimed exclusively at states. Preemption is a supremacy clause concept that regulates the relationship between the federal government and states. But (b)(5) speaks not only to that but also to the relationship between the law Congress passed and what the federal government may do, and, most importantly, as I was discussing earlier with Justice Kagan, what private employers may do with this information that they were compelled to collect and maintain in a novel manner back in 1986. And we think that explains your earlier question, Justice Alito, with respect to what does \"information contained in\" mean."
