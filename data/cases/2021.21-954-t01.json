But the -- the second point I'll make is that to the extent you are focused on this differential use of \"shall\" and \"may,\" I think that only fortifies our principal contention in this case, which is that the contiguous territory return provision uses that discretionary \"may return,\" and it's Respondents' position that would actually fail to give effect to Congress's drafting choices by turning that into a mandate."

Is that a limit -- you know, the Chief Justice said that if you're only considering capacity, that's a pretty capacious term and there might not be any limit. So do you have to -- do you have to take into account as a matter of statutory interpretation the public benefit, the significant public benefit of choosing that option, the parole into the United States option, rather than sending back to Mexico or whatever contiguous territory?"

And so, you know, here, I think that, on the ground, DHS immigration officers are looking at each individual non-citizen to make those judgments, and in -- in making those judgments, it's not even clear that there would be an alternative to return to Mexico for all of the reasons I listed before, because of the exclusions under the program, the non-refoulement obligations, the fact that Mexico would never agree or consent to accept everyone that we are currently paroling.

So I think the idea here that there is a single district court in Texas that is mandating those results, that is compelling the executive to engage in those ongoing negotiations, and is doing though -- so under the constant threat of a contempt motion from Texas to supervise our good-faith negotiations with Mexico shows that something has powerfully gone awry here.
