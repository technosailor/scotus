But the starting point of any remedial analysis would be the strong presumption in favor of severability, and, here, the text and statutory structure powerfully confirm that presumption. After a year of debate about the future of the ACA, Congress made a single surgical change."

What'll happen if we zero out the tax? And CBO came back and said, whether you zero out the tax or you repeal the mandate, the effects on the market will be the same, the market will remain stable over the coming decade. And if one looks at the amicus briefs filed by the health insurance industry, the Blue Cross brief, the AHIP brief, if one looks at the AMA brief, all those briefs are confirming that that judgment was correct, that it turns out that the carrots worked without the stick and brought enough people in to the market to allow it to sustain itself. And, you know, Congress is allowed to learn from experience, empirical experience in the world, and adjust its policy choices."

A lot of people, a lot of members, in 2017 may well have thought that eliminating the penalty or the tax would not cause any harm and the whole Act could continue to function well without it, but others who voted for it may have done so precisely because they wanted the whole thing to fall. So I don't know what we can make of what was done in 2017 along the lines that you've said."

And I'm pointing specifically at what the plaintiffs in this case sometimes call the inseverability provision, which is a finding, basically, that the mandate was essential to creating effective health insurance markets. And I guess I'm wondering, what do we do about that, the fact that that finding still exists in the law? Does that constrain us in any way?"

Now the argument that my friends on the other side are making is that the 2017 Congress must have continued to agree with that finding because it didn't repeal the finding. But the 2017 Congress couldn't possibly have agreed that a requirement backed by a tax consequence was essential to an effective market because the 2017 Congress eliminated the tax consequence.

On standing, the regulatory burden that is imposed today by the IRS forms is the most straightforward way to conclude that the states have suffered a pocketbook injury. And, in any event, Department of Commerce versus New York confirms that the states suffer another pocketbook injury as a predictable consequence of ordering people to sign up for insurance. Second, on severability, we submit that even if this Court is disinclined to invalidate every provision of the ACA, it should at a minimum agree with the Obama administration that under the text of the law, the mandate is inseverable from the three-legged stool. Third, on practical effects, I want to emphasize that we recognize the reliance interests at stake in this regulatory regime. The district court has stayed its partial final judgment. If this Court were to agree with us that the ACA is invalid, that stay could be extended for an appropriate time to allow the states and political branches of the federal government an opportunity to accommodate those reliance interests, as we saw this Court do in cases like Northern Pipeline versus Marathon Oil.

You know, a lot of legislation now is in these huge packages, I mean, even more than the ACA, that -- that involve a thousand different subjects, omnibus legislation where it's just everybody pours everything in that they can think of.
