  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2014, a general court-martial composed of a military judge alone found Michael Briggs guilty of rape in violation of Article 120(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a) (2000), for conduct that occurred in 2005. Briggs did not raise the statute of limitations before or during the trial, and the military judge did not advise him that the statute of limitations might provide a basis for dismissal. The judge sentenced Briggs to a dismissal, confinement for five months, and a reprimand.</p>\n<p>Briggs first raised the statute of limitations when he appealed to the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), but that court rejected his challenged because he had not raised the statute of limitations at trial. The court therefore affirmed the finding and sentence of the judge below. Briggs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Reviewing for plain error, the C.A.A.F. reversed the lower court, finding that the Rules for Courts-Martial R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B) requires the military judge to inform the accused of the right to assert the statute of limitations. As such, the court found that if the military judge had informed Briggs of a possible statute of limitations defense, he would have sought dismissal.</p>\n",
