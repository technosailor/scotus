And I think, if you have a test that requires juries or courts to balance seven or 13 factors to decide whether a likelihood of confusion exists in the United States, that's the sort of very-difficult-to-apply test that Morrison said should not be how we apply U.S. laws to foreign conduct.

Seventy years of experience shows that the floodgates haven't opened and that the Lanham Act has instead served as a bulwark against infringement that has an obvious and substantial and, in this case, a decidedly intended effect on U.S. commerce just as Congress provided. Petitioners' demand that the Act should now be weakened should be addressed to Congress, not this Court. But even if the Court were to conclude that the Act applies only domestically, it should still affirm because Petitioners' infringement implicated both concerns of the Act here: harm to mark-holders and harm to consumers. Hetronic suffered from infringement right here in the United States, and Petitioners obtained their ill-gotten gains from a web of infringing uses, all of which were likely to confuse American consumers. And with that, I'd be happy to answer the Court's questions."
