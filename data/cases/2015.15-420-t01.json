And courts that have considered the constitutionality of those schemes have reasoned that there's nothing inherently problematic with giving effect to that civil adjudication.

So I think that the nature of the proceeding here really is critical in helping to understand why Congress's judgment was rational, why the -- why the Indian Civil Rights Act represents a reasonable baseline level of -- of procedural fairness that's guaranteed to tribal-court defendants, and why there's nothing wrong, then, with giving effect to those tribal-court judgments if the defendant fails to learn from his past behavior and his past punishment.

So I do think that that reflects legislative judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective of individual rights, and that there's no fundamental unfairness that's occurring in those proceedings that would cause, I think, this Court to question the reliability of those determinations.

And then the final thing I would note is that although there's been a lot of talk about fairness here, I think it is important to recognize that Respondent had it entirely within his power to not have a Federal court consider these prior tribal court convictions.",
