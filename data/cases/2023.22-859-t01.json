This Court should reject all three of the Fifth Circuit's reasons for upsetting that longstanding and entrenched practice. First, this Court's decision in Atlas Roofing considered many of the same arguments presented today and reaffirmed that Congress does not violate the Seventh Amendment when it authorizes an agency to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings to enforce a federal statute."

Finally, the APA's limited removal protection for ALJs is entirely consistent with this Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund. There, the Court confronted an unprecedented agency, a powerful law enforcement board, that was insulated from removal because -- by an unusually stringent provision and that was not subject to the SEC's control. Here, in contrast, ALJs are purely adjudicative officers who are subject to the Commission's plenary control and review of their decisions, and the APA's modest for-cause removal standard gives the Commission ample authority to remove those ALJs if they fail to accept supervision. I welcome the Court's questions."

Murray's Lessee, City of Arlington, this Court has long recognized that it's executive power to apply the law to the facts and impose consequences prescribed by law in particular cases. So, from the question of asking has Congress tried to assign an Article III power to some entity that's not an Article III, we think it hasn't done that when it's authorized an agency to find facts and impose consequences in enforcing the law. As to specific distinctions on securities, so it's not just it's a different enforcer, it's also that the requirements look different."

You know, Atlas itself is relying on a line of decisions that go back to Helvering versus Mitchell, to the two Elting cases, to Stranahan from 1909, and even before that, all of which stand for the same proposition that civil penalties in government enforcement actions are permissible, consistent with Article III and the Seventh Amendment.

The concern that you mentioned many times was is the law of fraud being federalized. And when the law of fraud is being federalized, the Seventh Amendment is implicated because what the Seventh Amendment is doing is protecting the right of a person who has a common law fraud claim to bring it in federal court and not have it directed into some forum where they don't get a jury trial. So it seems to me that the initial question is, what is the right or the duty or whatever that is being established? And so Atlas Roofing begins by acknowledging that the Act created a new statutory duty, right? So, when we have this new statutory duty, it's not a common law duty, the question is, can this new duty be directed to an administrative tribunal without Seventh Amendment protections or not? And Atlas Roofing says of course because it's a new duty."

                "text": "Exactly, Justice Kagan. And I think the growth of civil penalties in administrative proceedings in particular, a lot of that is traceable to a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States in the 1970s that said this is a practice that is, you know, on sound constitutional footing. Some agencies have long had it, but we think there would be real salutary benefits both to the regulated parties and to the agencies of giving them the authority to do this because it can be done more efficiently in administrative proceedings because often administrative penalties are a lesser sanction than some of the penalties that were at stake there, like permanent debarment from an industry or revocation of a license or something like that. And Congress has taken that ball, blessed by this Court in Atlas Roofing, and really run with it in a lot of other statutes since."

Bernhard, where the Court held that a shareholder derivative action against directors and third parties under one of the securities acts, the Investment Company Act, which prevented larceny, embezzlement, misrepresentations, the same exact claims that are alleged in this -- in this case here against Mr. Jarkesy, back then, under the common law, a shareholder derivative action had to be in a court of equity."

Like, what makes it hard is when a statutory scheme looks like it could be displacing the normal common law private-to- private enforcement of a fraud claim. But I think what Justice Kagan is saying is that the reason why these cases, the ones in which the statute is giving the enforcement authority to the government for the benefit of the public, are not hard and why people haven't continued to bring these is because it doesn't look anything like the common law scenario where we've had two private parties fighting over fraud and they brought it to court. Instead, Congress has created a new thing to supplement that private scenario or maybe it's brand new in any event, but it doesn't -- it's not a common-law-rooted kind of thing that is being brought in court -- I mean, sorry, brought in the administrative agency with all the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised."
