My understanding is that you think the generic nature of the alleged misstatement is powerful evidence of the lack of price impact.

We largely agree with the government. I think we part ways on just two key points. On the first question presented, we don't agree with the government that the Court should issue an open-ended remand so that the court of appeals can clarify the legal rule that it was applying. We believe, as I indicated in my colloquy with Justice Kagan, that the court of appeals unambiguously held that the generic nature of the statements could not be considered in the price impact inquiry. And if this Court remands rather than reversing outright, we would submit that it should do so with clear direction as to how to conduct the inquiry, as I indicated in my discussion with Justice Kavanaugh. On the second question presented, we respectfully submit that the government fails to come to grips with the language of Rule 301. The government offers no valid reason why it should not apply to the presumption that Basic created. And in light of the court of appeals' legal errors on both questions and the need to provide guidance to the lower courts, this Court should not simply vacate but reverse the court of appeals' judgment."

But, if that's true, then we would just urge this Court to clarify that so that there's no mistaking what the law is for parties and litigants and lower courts. As to how the generic nature of the statement might be used, I think, as Mr. Shanmugam said, all parties agree now that the more generic a statement, the less likely it is to have actually caused a price impact."

The parties largely seem to agree with each other and with us on the first question presented, and the only lingering disagreement appears to be whether the generic nature of a misstatement must be introduced solely through expert evidence. And in our view, there's no sound reason to impose that kind of artificial limit. The more generic a statement is, the less likely it is to have had a price impact. And there's nothing wrong with the Court taking that likelihood into account as part of its calculus about which one of two competing narratives to credit, just like it would do with credibility or the Daubert factors. On the second question, Rule 301 doesn't answer the question because it says the burden remains on the party who had it originally."

And we can imagine cases, particularly where materiality hasn't been decided, where there is no expert testimony that's necessary. Now how did we get to the point where everybody agrees? We got here because the Petitioners have abandoned their argument in the court of appeals and in the cert petition that what the Court should do is just evaluate materiality and determine as a per se matter that the statement is too generic to ever have price impact. What we do need to understand is that the court of appeals already applies the rule that everyone is asking for here, and the United States, I think, has properly moved to the point of saying, well, there is some ambiguity in parts of the Second Circuit's opinion, but you can resolve that just by making clear how you understand the court of appeals to rule. And so I want to focus on what actually is the rule in the Second Circuit."

On rebuttal, I want to explain why this case is more significant than Mr. Goldstein suggests and why the Court needs to answer the first question as well as the indisputably presented second one. Since Halliburton II, defendants have been able to rebut the Basic presumption by showing no price impact in only five cases. Plaintiffs have used the inflation maintenance theory to make it very difficult to rebut that presumption because that theory prohibits a defendant from showing that a statement had no price impact at the time it was made. The court of appeals' holdings on the two questions presented, taken together, take a defendant's burden from very difficult to effectively impossible. In an inflation maintenance case, the only way a defendant can rebut the presumption is by showing that a corrective disclosure had no impact on the stock price."

This Court should bring this multi-year fight over class certification to an end because, in this case, it could not be clearer that there is a complete mismatch between the misstatements and the corrective disclosures, particularly once the abundant information already in the public domain is taken into account. And Respondents' sole expert, Dr. Finnerty, offered nothing more than speculation about the cause of the price drop. This is an easy case because Respondents presented abundant and unrebutted evidence of the absence of price impact. If this Court permits the class certification to stand or permits the court of appeals to reinstate it on remand, anything a company does that leads to a stock drop is securities fraud and gives rise to a valid class action."
