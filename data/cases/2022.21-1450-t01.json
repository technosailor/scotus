And, finally, the results that I said are borderline, you know, cataclysmic, that 50 states, all counties, and any city in this country that has prosecution authority would all of a sudden have jurisdiction to prosecute any country qua country, and because Congress has expressly waived immunity and canceled it out on the statute, the executive branch can't do anything about it.

And, again, what worries me and why I think Congress should have a vote is I don't think -- not every President and every foreign country may feel the way our President does. And all we're saying is that Congress should speak clearly before opening up federal courts to that jurisdiction. Once Congress has its say-so, then there's nothing you can do about any prosecution."

But, here, we're talking about just what are sovereign and what are non-sovereign actions, the kinds of things that have been held to be sovereign actions, for example, the one foreign case they have on this, the French Supreme Court case involved the flagging of ships and registration of ships, which is exclusively something a sovereign could do, but it's not something that I think even the British common law courts had too much trouble with. If you compare the Nabob of the Carnatic case and the Moodalay case that are cited in our briefs, which I believe both around the time or predate the founding, they distinguish between, for example, treaty-making authority of the East India Company, for which it couldn't be sued, and the just normal contracting authority for which it could."

And, in particular, this Court -- I think there are four principles that kind of show that these kinds of prosecutions are possible, all of which date back to the founding. One is prosecutions against foreign officials, which date back at least to the 1790s. The second would be the well-recognized difference between a corporation and the state, which likewise dates back prior to the founding. The third would be the well-recognized distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign functions, which goes from the East India cases up to the French Supreme Court case and is, frankly, embodied in the FSIA today.

And let me just make a quick point on why this is clearly not a jurisdictional rule. I don't think the Court needs to look any further than pages 758 and 759, I think it is, of Ex parte Peru, in which the Court makes quite clear -- and this is another one of these in rem ship cases -- that the court has jurisdiction, it's just a question of whether it declines or doesn't decline to exercise it. That's perfectly consistent with Schooner Exchange, which talks about waiving jurisdiction, although it spells it without an I, and it also refers to actions that are taken by the sovereign that are clearly actions the executive would take, like barring foreign warships from U.S. ports, which would be something you'd expect the President to do, not something that you'd expect any other branch of government to do."
