First, I think, in answer to a question that had been raised earlier, I think by the Chief Justice, the reason that the common law history predating the First Amendment matters is because, just as in Tenney with legislative immunity, I think the idea is that the Constitution's grant of the disciplinary power and the expulsion power reflects a well-understood, universal, long-established tradition of legislative bodies. And then the idea there between -- you know, in -- by analogy to cases like Tenney and Bogan against Scott-Harris, because it's such a well-developed and well-understood power of these elected bodies, even in states or in localities where it hasn't expressly been codified in the Constitution, we should presume that unless some provision of positive law removes the power, that it exists by virtue of there being an elected body. And so I think just by analogy to legislative immunity, Tenney and Bogan, I would say the same thing should apply here."

But I think what you would do in that scenario, if you adopt our first historical argument, is you would ask the same question: Is this the kind of disciplinary power that has been exercised by elected bodies, and then would the exercise of that power in response to a member's speech abridge that member's freedom of speech? And on this front, I guess I can offer just analogies, right?

And, finally, the censure imposed these penalties pursuant to the Board's official disciplinary authority. The resolution thus recited several rules codified in the Board's code of conduct. It made formal findings that these rules had been violated by Mr. Wilson's speech."

I think it -- it's critical to recognize that this is not just a formality. Bylaws of local elected bodies throughout the country recognize an important distinction between disciplinary proceedings and other proceedings, and they provide trial-like protections before censures may be imposed. Robert's Rules of Order, which my friend on the other side has observed is incorporated into a great many such bylaws, recognizes the same, that when a censure is proposed on the basis of conduct taking place outside of the lawmaking body itself, that formal charges must be made, that notice must be given, a trial must be held."

Then, in the other, they say the exact same thing except they find a rule, and they say: You know, in fomenting distrust of the Board, he's violating Rule ABCD against fomenting distrust of the Board.

If affirmed, this case will go back to the Fifth Circuit, and I presume the Fifth Circuit would have to give a limiting instruction under its ruling asking a jury to answer the question of whether Mr. Wilson was entitled to mental anguish damages solely on the basis of the words in the censure but not on the other measures because the Fifth Circuit said those can't give rise to a free speech retaliation claim.
