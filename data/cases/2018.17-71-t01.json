It's an attractive area for development because it's connected to centers of -- where jobs -- where the jobs are. And yet -- so we have a Unit 1 that is already zoned, it's outside the flood zone, and it's well served by roads connecting it to jobs, but the Service treated every undeveloped area in the parish as fungible and said this just isn't an important development area, even though St. Tammany, as its brief explains in this case, says no, it's a very important development area. The -- that is what you get when there's no judicial review, when an agency thinks that there are no controls over what it concludes. And the economic analysis is riven through with very basic errors of that kind. And I would submit that without the possibility of judicial review in cases like this, that is what you get, a very unsatisfactory balancing. And that is what State Farm is for. State Farm is there to ensure that when a balancing like this has to be done, when there are multiple factors to be considered, that the agency gets it fairly right as to what those factors are and then connects up the dots between what those factors are and what its ultimate conclusion is."
