But when they do nothing to address the reliance interests and they just say, gosh, we really think we were right all along, why is anybody, especially in the Fourth and Fifth Circuit, supposed to change the way they're doing things, and that's the only way that they say that they can even possibly get within the protection against massive, retroactive damage liability.
