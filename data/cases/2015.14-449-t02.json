The Kansas Court said it was applying Boyde, but then it went on to conduct no actual Boyde analysis other than what Your Honor points to, which is simply the State said repeatedly, in both cases, that there is a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the State must prove with respect to aggravators, and also with respect to the weighing factor. And the mere silence on the other side somehow led the Kansas Court to conclude that Boyde was violated because jurors would have inferred what was imposed on the State must also have been imposed on the Respondent.",

Next sentence: \"And the penalty phrase\" -- \"phase instructions as a whole exacerbated the error because they referred only to the State's burden of beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which, of course, will always be true because it's constitutionally required that the jurors be informed the State, the government bears that burden beyond a reasonable doubt. The Kansas Court then concluded in the next sentence -- I won't read it because I've cited it before -- but under these circumstances, in other words, when there is an instruction that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt and there is silence on the other side, we conclude there is a reasonable likelihood that -- the Boyde is violated -- I'm summarizing, of course -- it is conclusory and nothing else.
