And, for example, if at my home I pour whiskey from a bottle into a flask and then I bring the flask to a party at a different location and I pour whiskey into the punch bowl there, nobody would say that I had added whiskey to the punch from the bottle. It would be true that the punch -- that the whiskey originated in the bottle, its route was fairly traceable from the bottle to the punch bowl, and it wound up in the punch bowl, but you wouldn't say it was added to the punch from the bottle. Now, at the other extreme, if I brought the bottle to the party and I poured it, the whiskey from a few inches above the surface of the punch and so it traveled through air or if it traveled through a funnel so it passed over a solid surface, in ordinary parlance, we wouldn't say that simply because there was some spatial gap between the bottle and the punch, therefore, I didn't add it from the -- the bottle to -- to the punch. In between those two extremes, I don't think that the \"to\" and \"from\" will get you all the way home."

So I think the -- the mere fact that there are -- are nutrients that are getting into the ocean doesn't mean that the system has failed. And I think it comes back to the fact that, in this particular circumstance, these wells were constructed with encouragement and funding from EPA as a more environmentally protective solution than simply constructing an outfall pipe to the ocean. If I can come back to the traceability point, I think it's also important to note, my friend runs very far away from the septic tank examples, and, Justice Kagan, to answer your question about traceability, there are 7,000 cesspools within 750 feet of the ocean in Hawaii, and we cite to a study in our reply brief that showed that through a tracer, dye tracer study, not dissimilar from what was used here, it was established that pollutants from individual septic tanks were getting to the ocean within three hours to five days. So traceability can be done."
