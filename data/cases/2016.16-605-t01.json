I'd like to start where Justice Ginsburg started by focusing on how it works, sort of how you establish standing when you're talking about intervenors, and particularly, defendant intervenors. Like Justice Ginsburg, most of the courts of appeals that have held the other way have held that standing is not required, have focused on whether an intervenor can establish standing to initiate a lawsuit. But in our view, that is not the appropriate focus. What the rule itself focuses on is whether an intervenor could be injured by the disposition of the pending lawsuit. And so the -- it's -- it's much more like asking whether a party has standing to appeal than it is like asking whether a party would have standing to initiate a lawsuit.",
