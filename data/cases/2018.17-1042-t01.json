There are three main sources that each establish that, instead, compensation includes employer payments for hours when an employee is absent from active service, including time lost.

As to precedent, since 1946, this Court has construed parallel language in the Social Security Act to reach all payments arising out of the employer/employee relationship, including time lost. And, Justice Kavanaugh, to your question about whether that continues to be good law, this Court reaffirmed that precedent. It applied it in Quality Stores just in 2014. And those decisions support also construing the RRTA to reach time lost. And, third, this interpretation appropriately reflects the interlocking structure of the RRTA and the parallel benefits statute known as the RRA."

I think the RRB says, nonetheless, the employer and the employee are allowed to come in even after the judgment and allocate it between time lost and -- and other sources. And we think, you know, that's -- that's what's -- h(2), which is still in the RRA, suggests is the appropriate way to handle this. And I think h(2) is also the part of the answer on pain and suffering. h(2) clearly contemplates that when you have a judgment, it's going to contain in part taxable payments for time lost and also other kinds of damages and that you're going to need to divide these two things up to figure out, you know, what's compensation. And we think there's a common-sense reason for treating pain and suffering as different, which is lost -- lost time payments are a substitute for something that's taxable. They're a substitute for wages that -- that the employee would have been taxed on."

But, for vacation pay, if you're a federal employee and you have a 40-hour pay stub and it shows a certain number of hours that you've accrued for vacation pay, those are all for the services that you rendered as an employee. Now, with respect to worker's compensation, because it's an insurance scheme that is no fault, it operates in a very different way in terms of how it is funded. There's no pre-funding on the part of the railroad for FELA damages. The whole point of the FELA is to impose a duty of due care on the industry so that workers are not being injured as a result of the railroad's negligence. And that's why Justice Brandeis in the Winfield case in the early 1920s made very clear that an FELA judgment is a penalty for the breach of a duty of due care. And Justice Scalia, in his separate writing in Cleveland Indians, said, in his view, the question is different as to whether or not it is a court-ordered judgment that is not the way you ordinarily think of wages paid, which is the way that the phrase is used under So, if you look at these textual differences, the line-drawing, I think, Justice Gorsuch, is actually pretty straightforward. You ask the question: Is the work and the pay here, the compensation, for services rendered? And if it's not, which, clearly, it couldn't be here because Mr. Loos was unable to render services, then it is outside the realm of the"

But, on the history point, the other side, notwithstanding our challenge, cannot give you one instance, not one, where the IRS issued a deficiency notice because there had been a failure to pay RRTA taxes for an FELA judgment. If you look at the Federal Judicial Center's website, there have been something like 71,000 FELA suits filed just since 1970. Now, surely, if this had been the way the taxing service had been construing this statute, there would be at least $1 deposited from the Treasury as a result of an FELA judgment and a deficiency notice for a failure to do that.

But I would point out, secondly, that this TAM, this 1980 reference, concerns a version of the statute that no longer exists. It was part of the statute -- it was construing a statute that was in effect up until 1975. And, Justice Kavanaugh, you're correct, at that time, that's when the time lost language was taken out of the statute. That 1980 TAM was construing the previous version of the statute that doesn't exist anymore. So, for purposes of understanding where there has been consistency or inconsistency, there's been rank inconsistency because the IRS has -- has said different things in different means that are entitled to different levels of respect."

And if you do not allocate the back-pay award to particular months, then the Railroad Retirement Board doesn't have a basis for saying how you count it up toward the -- the creditable service. And because the way the benefits work, it doesn't typically benefit you to have 18 years of service or 17 years of service. You've got to get to 20 years now in order to get to a new threshold. This matter as a practical thing, Justice Breyer, simply was not deemed to be so significant as to affect things. I would further point out, as the Board, the Railroad Retirement Board's latest annual report indicates, the retirement system is going to be solvent for the next 29 years. You've got to ask the question: What difference does it make whether or not you impose the tax, except as a means of altering the bargaining leverage between the railroads and their workers, when the railroads have breached the duty of due care and caused injury to their workers. If the Court has nothing further, we'll submit."

But, on the settlement leverage, whatever you think happens about allocation -- and this goes to you, Justice Sotomayor -- regardless of what you do in this case, 231 for the benefits side requires allocation in every case for personal injury judgment. Now, if we prevail, whatever happens in terms of allocation on the taxing side, it is treated with parity on the benefits side. And that is to say, if employees are underreporting their taxes, they're going to get an underreporting in benefits. If they win, there is no downside, and the law allows them to allocate an entire award to the benefits side, without any tax burden. So I think we win in terms of the dynamic to the net benefit on Treasury. If you're worried about settlement dynamics, I mean, that is because of the h -- h(2), h(2), yes, in 231 allows employees to allocate. The third thing, I do want to defend the government here, because -- about this 1981 TAM."
