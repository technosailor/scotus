We've never had to address this issue, and the reason is because Congress and the President have reached accommodations with each other, and sometimes one has gotten more and sometimes the other has gotten more, but there has always been this accommodation-seeking. And what it seems to me you're asking us to do is to put a kind of 10-ton weight on the scales between the President and Congress and essentially to make it impossible for Congress to perform oversight and to carry out its functions where the President is concerned. And you're quite right in what you said before, that this isn't going to be the last such case, and I wonder whether that fact isn't a good reason to reject your proposed rule."

But, if there was some situation in which Congress was actually -- you know, had -- had -- had put forth a statute for which they -- they needed some information to decide whether to enact a statute, the statute was valid, and for some reason the President's personal papers were necessary to inform Congress, then perhaps in that case it could meet the demonstrated need statute. I can't imagine that any of these subpoenas could come close, given how far back they look and how much of a dragnet they set up.

And on the need side, because of the dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President, and that's a common theme that runs through the Court's cases, that the President gets some measure of heightened protection because you can't proceed against the President as against an ordinary litigant.

Obviously, Congress could do a very thorough investigation of that to determine whether to pass a different criminal law statute that would actually make it a crime to -- to do what was done in -- in Bridgegate.

But isn't the whole point that once you start down this road and this Court articulates too low a standard, that something like that will start happening? That's the concern that I heard identified or that I took away from that hypothetical. So I want to give you a chance to respond to that hypothetical of why it wouldn't spiral."
