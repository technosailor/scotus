But, unlike the Axon case, in which the plaintiff is a corporation, this case illustrates the crucial importance of this district court jurisdiction for everyday Americans who find themselves trapped before an unconstitutional agency decisionmaker. The SEC acts as prosecutor, judge, and, in effect, executioner in its own proceedings, all of which give it an extraordinary home court advantage."

And we agree wholeheartedly with the Fifth Circuit that those provisions unambiguously leave district court jurisdiction over the structural constitutional claims at issue. I think one reading of Thunder Basin is that the Court applied those factors as a means of discerning congressional intent so that ultimately the Court was engaging in an inquiry into what Congress intended, albeit not in the way the Court would typically construe a statute. But I think there's a -- there's an important threshold consideration that explains why Thunder Basin doesn't deal with this sort of case."

And -- and -- and I think it matters. I mean, one of the things that your colleague on the other side pointed out is that maybe there was a reason why Congress would have wanted that to be made later, in part because it may avoid having to have judicial review at all. And, traditionally, our thought has been you don't jump in to decide constitutional questions, and if there's a way to avoid it, you do. So it seems rational to me that when Congress was putting off even court of appeals review in this case, it was saying anything that you have related to the sort of constitutional nature of this, wait until the agency finishes, and then everything can be brought at that time."

In that respect, she does have to bet the farm because, you know, although it's unlikely given the -- the agency's track record, if she won on the merits -- of course, we believe that she shouldn't -- but, if she won, she wouldn't be able to present her structural constitutional claim to a court of appeals ever. And, again, I mean, just on the meaningful judicial relief, I wanted to emphasize this point that Mr. Clement made in rebuttal."

I'm wondering whether, to temper my concern that allowing for 1331 jurisdiction to occur for those structural claims while the agency has the issue, could we also say it has to be structural and constitutional, but it has to be the kind of thing that would permit the district court to completely terminate the agency proceeding so that we don't have, like -- we don't have it operating like an interlocutory review of an ongoing agency proceeding, but we have this requirement that the remedy that you're seeking as the person who's bringing the structural claim is to shut the whole thing down."

And time after time, the Court has said that's not a sufficient basis for getting immediate review rather than waiting until the end of the process. The -- the one exception that I noted at the beginning of my first argument was, in the collateral order context, the Court has recognized that orders denying a -- a statutory or constitutional immunity will ordinarily be appealable immediately.

Again, you could have come out the -- the -- with the same bottom line by saying, yes, there was jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims, but the only cause of action that you had was elsewhere and so your suit is dismissed. And in stressing the jurisdictional aspect of this, we have tried to brief and argue the case in -- in the way that this Court has approached similar cases in the past, but, certainly, the -- the part of our brief that addressed a cause of action was intended to make the point that, even if you take the view that -- that Justice Alito has propounded and that Axon and Cochran have endorsed, in which anything that asserts a claim under federal law by definition arises within the district court's jurisdiction, it's a plausible way of approaching it, but the suits still couldn't go forward because they're not challenging anything that you can sue about. And -- and, again, to us, the salient feature of cases like Elgin, whether or not you think it was right to couch this as a jurisdictional problem, is in deciding whether your suit can go forward in the court that you filed it in, we need to look at the agency action you're challenging, not at the legal theory you are asserting as a basis for finding that action invalid."

But it's fair -- there's a big difference between saying the courts can step in to fill the gaps, as in Free Enterprise Fund, where the APA didn't apply, or as in some other cases, where Presidential action is at issue and the President is not an APA action. It's very different to say a court can step in and fill the gaps and say the court can provide a cause of action kind of contrary to the dictates of the APA. And, as I said in the first argument, under Section 703, the APA -- we think of an APA suit as a suit in district court kind of under the APA's fallback authorization when no special review provision exists.

Now I -- I take the thrust of the argument on the other side to be that structural constitutional challenges are not simply challenges that fall within the 1331 jurisdiction but challenges that can actually be brought in court and that will surmount any other types of non-jurisdictional challenges because it's uniquely important that they be adjudicated quickly. If -- if I've misunderstood Mr. Garre's argument, he can correct me, but I took their argument to be, with respect to structural constitutional claims, not just that the district court would have jurisdiction but that the court would be obligated to decide them on the merits."
