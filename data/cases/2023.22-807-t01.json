You can see how there would be direct evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to make a majority/minority district, so we're going to have some evidence of people saying that. But, in a situation like this, where that is not the case, where the state is saying instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand -- and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to prove just on its own.

And I think that's -- I think that's right, but I guess what I am trying to understand is how the BVAP stays the same unless you're looking at race so that if you bring in the district with more Trump voters, the assumption, I think, that everybody seems to be operating under is that you would -- that district would likely have more white voters in it because race is correlating with -- with -- with politics.

So we're asking whether the district court made a clear error in light of the fact that it was judging the factual record with those things into account. And the Chief Justice has outlined, you know, kind of the sum I think in a -- in a pretty concise way of the evidence which was all circumstantial here. I think there's a reason why Dr. Ragusa's report keeps coming up, is because it was the best of the expert reports that actually did try to disentangle race and politics, which was the key question here.

And I will also say that, you know, my friend has made the point that, you know, it's -- your -- theoretically possible that you can go pretty deep into a county under that analysis, but that is what the map-makers did. They took in the entirety of two counties and went to their furthest reaches when they drew the map, and so I think it was reasonable for Dr. Ragusa's analysis to do the same thing in figuring out the area from which he could draw."
