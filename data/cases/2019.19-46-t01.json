So, for that reason, we think Goodyear continues to control for the same reason that this other preexisting common law does. But even taking a view sort of outside of Goodyear, as I take your question to suggest, even without Goodyear, you have this very basic trademark policy that has always been true, which is that generic terms simply are not susceptible to appropriation by a particular business, even when there's secondary meanings. This Court recognized that in Two Pesos following the Lanham Act, citing Judge Friendly's quintessential sort of categories of terms, and I think it remains true on the Internet, just as it remains true in the brick-and-mortar world."

I think it's worth noting, on pages 6 and 8 of Respondent's brief, their test actually requires them, I think, to hedge as to whether the words \"Oranges\" or \"Oranges, Inc.\" or, I presume, \"Oranges.com\" would be generic."

Now the other point that Respondent makes with respect to the -- the codification of the primary significance test, you know, I don't think it's actually the primary significance test that's the core of Respondent's argument. Respondent's argument is much more that that test must always and in all circumstance require looking to survey evidence and giving that survey evidence dispositive weight. I think that's not true under Goodyear, which I think is wholly reconcilable with the primary significance test, because Goodyear itself, on page 602 of the opinion, rejected evidence as legally irrelevant that one particular defendant had sort of the best claim to public association."
