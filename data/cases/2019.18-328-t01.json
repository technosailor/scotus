When Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common law rule eventually known as the discovery rule applicable to cases of fraud and concealment. Citing to and quoting the Bailey decision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in 1946, this Court stated that it had long ago adopted as its own the old chancery rule, that where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any false or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered, though there will be no special circumstance or efforts on the part of the party committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge of the other party. The Court then continued in Holmberg explaining unequivocally this equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitation and added even those where \"an explicit statute of limitation for bringing suit.\" The United States concedes, as it has in prior cases, that there is a common law discovery rule applicable to fraud and concealment. In the decision below, the Third Circuit never mentioned the Holmberg case."

An example that I'm familiar with from my own practice is in antitrust cases, where although they use the label of fraudulent concealment, which I think is best understood separately as a close cousin of the discovery rule, in those circumstances, you have a violation alleged of, say, Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy. And most cases, when there's a statute of limitations argument that the conduct went back more than the four years provided in the statute, there's an argument about whether the conspiracy was concealed. Most courts there require some additional action in addition to the -- the -- there the conspiracy itself."

And we -- we agree with Respondent that that difference matters, not just with respect to how clear a statute must be to displace or make clear that that doctrine doesn't apply, but also the scope of the rule that results, as the Court observed in Rotella.

And then the second element, diligence, is just the same across both -- both contexts. So it seems like a subset of the broader principle of equitable tolling, which explains why the Court's decisions in cases where it mattered, not just in ANZ but in Lampf and in Rotella, described cases like Holmberg and Bailey as falling into this bucket. So we -- we understand it to fall in the equitable tolling or the equitable relief side of the line, but, at the end of the day, to decide this case, I don't think you need to resolve that particular question. If it's any kind of equitable relief, I think Petitioner has disclaimed reliance on that and certainly didn't present that below or in the petition, but even if you think it's a -- a -- a statutory rule that could be read into every statute, we don't think this falls within the category of fraud claims. As Mr. Dvoretzky was explaining, I don't think the complaint here, the single allegation that concerns improper service, paragraph 14 of the complaint, doesn't allege any kind of misrepresentation, isn't premised on fraud. And to the point of amendment, when the district court asked Petitioner's counsel if he would like to amend -- and this is at page 104-A of the court of appeals appendix, Volume 2 -- Petitioner's counsel emphatically said no. So I think that ship has sailed. Ultimately, we don't have a strong interest in whether you apply that rule here or leave it to the Third Circuit, but I think respect for the court of appeals and the integrity of the certiorari process suggests that you should take the Petitioner -- the petition at its word and decide the case on those terms. If the Court has no further questions."

But, again, if you understand it as an application of equitable principles, you don't need to draw a line between the gravamen of the underlying claim, which is what Bailey focused on, the object or foundation of the suit, or other examples, like Holmberg, which wasn't a fraud action but involved fraudulent concealment.

In more recent cases, like Merck and Gabelli, has clearly identified a discovery rule which I think under the best reading is separate from equitable tolling. The second point is that there's an argument advanced in the briefs and today by both counsel for the Respondent of the United States that the issue is whether a statute is all or nothing."
