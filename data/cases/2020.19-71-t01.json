At the same time, where a suit is brought against the federal government, including against a federal official in his official capacity, as RFRA provides for, money damages are not appropriate relief. Prior to this Court's decision in Smith and the passage of RFRA, injunctive relief against a federal agency or official was the only appropriate relief for an asserted free exercise violation."

Congress has only very rarely departed from that general rule and subjected federal employees to personal damage suits."

And as -- as I said before, the context of RFRA, which is lifting burdens from generally applicable laws, I think, further weighs against Congress having done so because the individual employee is in the position of deciding whether to create an exemption, maybe on the spot, from generally applicable law, and damage actions could put the -- could put the employee in a difficult -- in a difficult bind. So, with respect to the self-contained system of -- of RFRA, we think it -- we think there's no reason to think that Congress would have wanted to do that."

In this context, the law of remedies, though, includes important other limitations, including the sovereign immunity of the sovereign, which is what renders money damages not appropriate relief against the government, and individual government officials are included only insofar as they are part of the government under RFRA's definition. In addition, as Justice Kagan pointed out, there -- there are reasons beyond that to expect Congress to be especially clear if it was subjecting federal employees to personal money damages under a statute, after all, that applies throughout the government, anytime there is a statute of general applicability, for example, that an employee is charged with administering. And, in fact, we know that Congress rarely provides or allows private damages actions against the federal government."

But this is putting a government employee in the position, perhaps on the spot, of deciding whether to create an exemption to a particular governmental interest."

So even looking at what the appropriate remedies are, they aren't available. And RFRA contains nothing like the action at law under 1983, which is what gives rise to damages there, to the extent RFRA was patterned after 1983."
