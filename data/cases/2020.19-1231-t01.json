The problem here is that the reconsideration order fails this basic requirement of administrative accountability. Based on zero information about female ownership and a nonsensical analysis of badly flawed data on minority ownership, the agency repeatedly assured the public that consolidation would do no harm to either. The government now asks for deference. It says that the uncertainty was acknowledged, prediction is hard, and it argues essentially that because no harm was shown, there was nothing to be waived. But because the no-harm findings here were wholly arbitrary, to defer on this record would only encourage agencies to do sloppy work to avoid making tough choices. Ultimately, if the Commission wants to give less weight to ownership diversity or even abandon the goal entirely, nothing in the Third Circuit's ruling stands in its way."

And although they talk a lot about the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, for the local TV changes, for example, that is the only evidence that they rely on for no harm, is this listing of numbers on page 37 of our brief. Finally, I would note that the remedial concerns don't undercut the Third Circuit's core conclusion here that the Commission undertook dramatic regulatory repeal without reasonably considering an aspect of the public interest I think it continues to espouse, the -- the -- the colloquy with Mr. Stewart notwithstanding. The Court can tweak the remedy as it sees fit, but the best course is to allow the Commission to consider these questions afresh in its 2018 review, where it can analyze the better data, including the full results of the incentive auction, to reach a reasoned decision on whether deregulation is actually in the public interest. For these reasons and others in our brief, the Third Circuit should be affirmed."
