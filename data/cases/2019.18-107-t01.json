The second and related textual issue is that the standard for determining whether or not you're discriminating against somebody because he's a man or because she's a woman is that you're treating that person differently than a similarly situated person of the opposite sex and taking an adverse employment action against them as a result. So the threshold question is always are the two people that you're comparing actually similarly situated? Now, my friends on the other side assert that a transgender man is, in fact, similarly situated to cisgender man, just like they assert that a gay woman is similarly situated to a straight man. But that is manifestly not true because, with respect to the transgender issue, the difference between a transgender man and cisgender man is that one identifies with his biological sex and the other identifies with the opposite of his biological sex."
