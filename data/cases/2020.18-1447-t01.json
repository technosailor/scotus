Nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act forecloses courts from applying that case-by-case abstention any more than it forecloses courts from applying the similar case-by-case analysis called for by the forum non conveniens doctrine. On the contrary, as Judge Katsas correctly explained below, Section 1606 of the FSIA requires that when foreign sovereigns can be sued in American courts at all, they must be treated no worse than private foreign defendants facing equivalent claims. Because private foreign defendants are free to seek comity-based abstention, Section 1606, therefore, requires that foreign sovereign defendants must be free to do so as well."

The potential availability of comity-based abstention in United States courts plays an important role in our diplomatic efforts on that issue. Accordingly, while the United States takes no position on the appropriateness of comity-based abstention in this particular case, the Court should make clear that the FSIA does not foreclose such abstention."

And so, if you're going to say sometimes you can have comity-based abstention, it would be helpful to have some guidance about when that is."

And so the sort of separation of powers and small fee conservative way that courts should sort of wade into foreign policy determinations points in the opposite direction in the two types of cases. Here, if a court says I'm going to abstain from exercising jurisdiction, it's countermanding foreign policy determinations that Congress has already made. In the ATS context, if a court says I'm going to recognize this inferred cause of action, it's kind of venturing out into a foreign policy way -- in a foreign policy way -- excuse me -- in a way that Congress has not yet done."

And so, for example, foreign sovereign immunity everyone agrees was a common law background doctrine -- excuse me, common law doctrine that was displaced by the FSIA. To the extent there was any separate comity abstention doctrine, which we don't think there was, but if you disagree, we think it was also subsumed within and displaced by the FSIA because, as Mr. -- my friend, Mr. Silbert, describes the comity-based inquiry, what the Court is supposed to do is -- is think about the dignity interests of the foreign sovereign. It's really hard to see how that is separate from the foreign sovereign immunity doctrine in a way that the FSIA was not intended to account for."

But that is not what Congress said in the FSIA, and the courts should not take on those policy -- foreign policy risks on their own without clear instructions from Congress and the executive. Last point: I think you should take the reciprocity concerns in this case very seriously, because it's an unfortunate fact but a -- a fact we all know, that the United States Government has sometimes fallen short of the ideals of justice that every nation should aspire to meet. And some people say that the United States owes large outstanding debts for injustices that were committed in this country. That's a profoundly important question, and maybe one day Congress will address it or maybe one day it will come before this Court. All right, that we can all agree, that the remedies for the worst injustices committed by the United States in the United States should not be decided by a Hungarian judge applying Hungarian law from a courtroom in Budapest. For the same reasons, the merits of this case should not be decided by an American judge applying American law in Washington, D.C."
