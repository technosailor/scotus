  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Arizona offers two methods of voting: (1) in-person voting at a precinct or vote center either on election day or during an early-vote period, or (2) \u201cearly voting\u201d whereby the voter receives the ballot by mail and either mails back the voted ballot or delivers the ballot to a designated drop-off location.</p>\n<p>Arizona law permits each county to choose a vote center or a precinct-based system for in-person voting. In counties using the vote-center system, registered voters may vote at any polling location in the county. In counties using the precinct-based system, registered voters may vote only at the designated polling place in their precinct. About 90% of Arizona\u2019s population lives in counties using the precinct-based system. If a voter arrives at a polling place and is not listed on the voter rolls for that precinct, the voter may cast a provisional ballot. After election day, election officials review all provisional ballots to determine the voter\u2019s identity and address. If officials determine the voter voted out of precinct (OOP), the county discards the ballot in its entirety, even if (as is the case in most instances), the OOP voter properly voted (i.e., was eligible to vote) in most of the races on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee challenged this OOP policy as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it adversely and disparately affects Arizona\u2019s Native American, Hispanic, and African American citizens.</p>\n<p>Arizona law has permitted early voting for over 25 years, allowing voters to request an early vote-by-mail ballot either on a per-election basis or on a permanent basis. Some counties permit voters to drop their early ballots in special drop boxes, but all counties permit the return of early ballots by mail, or in person at a polling place, vote center, or authorized election official\u2019s office. Many voters (particularly minorities) who vote early use third parties to collect and drop off voted ballots, which, until 2016, was permissible. Despite \u201cno evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona,\u201d Republican legislators in 2016 passed H.B. 2023, which criminalized the collection and delivery of another person\u2019s ballot. The DNC challenged H.B. 2023 as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment because it was enacted with discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p>After a ten-day bench trial, the district court found in favor of Arizona on all claims. The DNC appealed, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. A majority of the full Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the case en banc, and the court reversed, finding the district court \u201cclearly erred.\u201d</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>1. Does Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?</p>\n<p>2. Does Arizona\u2019s H.B. 2023 violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or the Fifteenth Amendment?</p>\n",
