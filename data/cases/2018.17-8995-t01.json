We also know that Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act determined that defendants should not be getting double credit for time they serve in presentencing confinement against another term of imprisonment.

We also have anomalous results that would occur if a -- a term of supervised release was tolled during only part of a defendant's sentence for another crime. In that context, you can imagine the timing of a defendant's guilty plea would then have an effect on his supervised release outcome. So, for example, if you had two identically situated defendants who entered jail on the same day and ultimately received the same criminal sentence, they would have different supervised release outcomes if one of them pleaded guilty after two months of detention and the other pleaded guilty after six months. You could also imagine a situation where you have two identical defendants who go to jail on identical offenses in different jurisdictions."

And the fact that 3624(e) elsewhere uses the word \"sentence\" but decided to shift to the word \"conviction\" in the context of the tolling provision indicates that Congress intended to refer to a different moment, a different event in the criminal adjudicative proceedings. We also know in the Sentencing Reform Act that Congress regularly used the word \"conviction\" or \"convicted\" to refer to the state of being adjudicated guilty before the entry of a sentence."

So the plain language of both 3624(e) itself and the larger statute of which it was a part indicate that conviction means the earlier moment in time. But even if a conviction referred to the judgment of conviction that happens in connection with the sentencing, a defendant is still imprisoned in connection with a conviction once he pleads guilty or is found guilty by a jury and is later detained, because that detention is at least in part to assure his appearance at sentencing and to ensure that he is there to receive the entry of the judgment of conviction that is largely certain at that point. And it also -- at that point, his -- his imprisonment becomes punitive because he no longer is subject to the presumption of innocence. So for all of those reasons, even, you know, what -- whatever meaning this Court gives to conviction, certainly, the period after his guilty plea would be tolled, we -- we believe that the entire period of his imprisonment would -- should be tolled because all of the time that he served on his state sentence, and is still serving on his state sentence, is in connection with those -- the state convictions that landed him in jail in the first place.
