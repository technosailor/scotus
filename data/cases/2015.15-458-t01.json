We simply don't think that there is any need for this Court to move the line from the point of discharge to the point of discharge plus one hour and what other -- whatever other limitations the government wants to impose under the abuse of discretion standard, particularly because a court will have the ability to correct obvious defects before discharge. And if this Court adopts our rule, it will, if anything, create incentives for courts and litigants going forward to pause for a moment at the point at which the jury's verdict is returned and published before discharge to determine whether there is an obvious error that can be corrected, consistent with the Court's power to do so prior to discharge. And we freely acknowledge that if a court wants to, for instance, take a short recess at that point, it can do so. And to the extent that the specter is given of elaborate new trials in complex cases where the trials have been particularly lengthy, I would respectfully submit that it is precisely in those cases where courts and litigants ought to have the incentive to do that. And the last thing I would say before reserving the balance of my time for rebuttal, to get back to Justice Alito's question, is that with regard to the Federal Rules, we're not just pointing to the specific rules like Rule 48 and Rule 51, the rules on polling and the rules on instructing juries.",

The rule we would apply is that if this is a situation where before the discharge the judge could have sent it back to the jury with a clarifying instruction, then the mere formal pronouncement of discharge does not bar the judge from doing that in a situation where no actual prejudice would result. The reason I said I think that relates to an area of confusion in this case is that in his argument up here, Petitioner's counsel has characterized this as a weight of the evidence problem.",

Again, we do freely concede, as Mr. Katyal points out, that a district court has the authority to reinstruct the jury and to order the jury to engage in further deliberations prior to discharge, and that will take care of many of the cases in the category of obvious errors.
