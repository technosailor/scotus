What I guess I don't understand is it seems to me that your argument is asking for an extension of the stay principle in the following way. So Section 3 tells us that once a district court decides, yes, yes, you can go to arbitration, then, upon application of a party, the district court has to stay the trial proceedings. Now, presumably, if a party doesn't ask, the district court can keep going."

To me, this is an easy case because I follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the statute that tells me to look there. Putting that aside, assuming that that's my view, okay, just assuming, please don't try to reargue the case, really, what I think you're doing is you're fighting about how the Nken factors should be addressed by courts below.

If you said you didn't want to have that automatic stay and you didn't trust Congress to impose it, you wanted to -- to abrogate it, you wanted to abrogate it yourself and apply the Nken factors, I think you'd have to look at a couple of things: one, this Court's 1974 decision that litigation burdens alone aren't irreparable harm; two, you'd want to look to the harms of confidentiality and whether or not they could be adequately protected; and three, I think it would mean at least a presumption in favor of a stay in 16(a) appeals in which there is a bargained-for allegation that this shouldn't belong in district court at all.

So, if you prevail in this case, is there a way to ensure that courts of appeals move quickly? Any appropriate thing we can say to ensure that courts of appeals move quickly so that we mitigate the harm to the rights that were raised appropriately about the other side?"

What you could say about mechanisms to do stuff, obviously, expediting the court of appeals, but there's also the ability, let's say that you have a witness that might pass away or something and you'd be harmed by the automatic stay, I think there's three things that could be done there. One is you could seek a limited remand from the court of appeals to allow the district court to take that evidence or something like that. Second, you could get that evidence in the arbitration process itself. And, third, district courts often have inherent powers to preserve the status quo and protect jurisdiction, and so that might also provide a mechanism to get that kind of testimony. Finally, if you're worried about it at the end of the day, Congress is the solution for that."

Again, this Court has held under very similar circumstances in the Nken case that when Congress includes particular language in one section but excludes it from another section of the same Act, that Congress acts intentionally and purposely with respect to the disparate inclusion and exclusion. And, here, in this case, we have two examples of this inclusion/exclusion dichotomy. First, we have Section 3 of the FAA itself, which includes a mandatory stay, and then we have Section 1292(d)(4)(B), which was part of the same Act as Section 16. Under basic rules of statutory construction then, Section 16 cannot be said to harbor a hidden automatic stay provision."
