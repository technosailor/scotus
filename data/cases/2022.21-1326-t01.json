And on that understanding of what -- of what -- you know, that's the basis why, when you're dealing with a case like this, the downside of saying we're going to ignore whether the actions taken were objectively reasonable, we're always going to allow subjective intent, guarantees, again, as the Solicitor General said in Safeco, you're going to have to weigh the attorney-client privilege in every single case. That seems to me not something Congress would have wanted. Two, we should have to put it in the context of -- of the scheme, right?
