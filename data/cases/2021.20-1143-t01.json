If Congress wanted that rule to apply to every section of the Act, it could have put it in a free-standing provision that applied globally, just like it did with Section 6 in saying that applications or petitions under the Act are treated as motions, or as it did in the international arbitration context under Section 203. Nothing stopped Congress from saying, for every pleading under the Federal Arbitration Act, you should look through to the underlying hypothetical nonexistent dispute and decide whether that would give rise to federal jurisdiction. That's exactly opposite the way the courts have functioned in determining federal jurisdiction on the face of the pleading for over a century."

First, when a federal court compels arbitration or stays a case on the front end, it has discretion where it sees the arbitration rat, the person who is going to fight tooth and nail, to retain jurisdiction over the case, and it can exercise the other authority under the Act as an ancillary matter, which is exactly how it normally works in the settlement context. You can have a federal claim, and it can -- it can be settled, and a court can retain jurisdiction over the case to supervise the settlement or put the settlement in the decree. And you can have situations then where the same settlement dispute will either be subject to federal jurisdiction or not, entirely based on whether the court exercises discretion to do that, and there's nothing wrong with that. This Court said in Vaden that federal jurisdiction often turns on how litigation unfolds."
