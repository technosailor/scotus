The government's position is that this result should somehow differ when an appellate panel reviewing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal finds that the jury erred in its determination and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Put another way, the government's position is that when a jury does its job correctly and acquits, a defendant may not be reprosecuted, but, when the jury fails to correctly discharge its duty, the government gets a do-over. That is what this Court in Burks called a purely arbitrary distinction."

There is no reason to think that the framers would have singled out venue as the one issue that goes to a jury, but the government's failure of proof does not yield an acquittal but rather a do-over. At bottom, an insufficiency-of-the- evidence determination, whether by a jury, a judge, or an appellate panel, must lead to a judgment of acquittal. I welcome the Court's questions."

But Petitioner's case basically boils down to, from start to finish, a conflation of a jury's general verdict of acquittal and a reviewing Court's determination that a conviction was improper or the result of constitutional error. This Court has squarely rejected that conflation, including in Scott, which was one of the trilogy of double jeopardy cases decided the same day as Burks."

And then he was reindicted in London and -- at the Old Bailey, and the judges gathered together and they decided unanimously that his plea of autrefois acquit was no good in London because it was -- his acquittal was on venue grounds.

So there is a Supreme Court case that discourages special interrogatories in criminal cases, and I think that's the reason why. But you're now going much further, because you're suggesting to me that a whole bunch of special issues, like a dispute about the date a crime occurred and whether it's in the statute of limitations, you're suggesting that if a reviewing court found the government failed to supply sufficient evidence to negate a statute of limitations defense, that the government could try that case again and collect more evidence. Why not?"

But that has no implications here. The government agrees it's not jurisdictional. The framers clearly didn't incorporate the jurisdictional principles of English common law, certainly not jurisdictional principles of later English common law into the Constitution. So I just -- if that's the best historical evidence, I think it underscores that the dominant practice here was the venue was respected and treated just the same as anything else that went to a general verdict of acquittal.
