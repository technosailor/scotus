  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Booking.com operates a website on which customers can make travel and lodging reservations and has used the name BOOKING.COM since at least 2006. In 2011 and 2012, Booking.com filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) four trademark applications for the use of BOOKING.COM as a word mark and for stylized versions of the mark.</p>\n<p>Under the Lanham Act, marks must be \u201cdistinctive\u201d to be eligible for protection, and generic terms are not distinctive. The USPTO examiner rejected Booking.com\u2019s applications, finding that the marks were not protectable because BOOKING.COM was generic as applied to the services for which it sought registration (online hotel reservation services, among others).</p>\n<p>The Lanham Act also allows protection for \u201cdescriptive\u201d terms that have acquired secondary meaning, or a mental association in the minds of consumers between the proposed mark and the source of the product or service. In the alternative, the USPTO concluded that the marks were merely descriptive and that Booking.com had failed to establish that they had acquired secondary meaning as required for trademark protection.</p>\n<p>Booking.com appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which affirmed the rejection of Booking.com\u2019s applications. The Board found that BOOKING.COM was a generic term for these types of services and therefore ineligible for trademark protection. Because \u201cbooking\u201d generically refers to \u201ca reservation or arrangement to buy a travel ticket or stay in a hotel room\u201d and \u201c.com\u201d indicates a\u00a0commercial website, the Board reasoned that consumers would understand the resulting term \u201cBOOKING.COM\u201d to refer to an online reservation service for travel\u2014the very services proposed in Booking.com\u2019s applications.\u00a0The district court reversed, ruling Booking.com had acquired secondary meaning.\u00a0A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit the district court's reversal.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does the addition by an online business of a generic top-level domain (\u201c.com\u201d) to an otherwise generic term create a protectable trademark, notwithstanding the Lanham Act\u2019s prohibition on generic terms as trademarks?</p>\n",
