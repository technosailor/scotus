In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here.

Petitioner leans heavily on a third provision, Section 7203, which makes certain willful violations a misdemeanor and which it says requires committing a crime to obtain judicial review."

Petitioner can do that by incurring the penalty, paying it, and suing for a refund. But even if 7203's application were ambiguous, the way to harmonize all three provisions is to hold that Congress meant what it said unambiguously in 6671 and the AIA, that these penalties are treated as taxes that must be litigated in refund suits, and resolve any lingering dispute about \"willfully\" to preserve Congress's choice. Petitioner's approach of leveraging one disputed word in another provision to override the clear text of 6671 and the AIA has things backwards."

The first suit may have some downstream consequence, but we accept that that may be too attenuated to say that the purpose of the suit is to restrain the assessment or collection of a tax. But you don't have any of those difficult line-drawing questions here. Petitioner says you should determine what the suit is aimed at, but the complaint on its face tells you what it's aimed at. If Petitioner prevails, the IRS will be unable to enforce this -- this notice requirement and -- or this reporting requirement, and it does so by assessing taxes.

I think, as you move further along that spectrum, it does become more attenuated. And I think it depends, in particular, on how that other regime works and how it is incorporated into tax law and what relief the plaintiff seeks.

Now as to -- this -- the government invites this Court to say that it would not be willful for us to take this path, but it has not asked this Court to overrule Cheek, and that's what the Court would have to do to reach that outcome. Cheek draws a clear distinction between taxpayers who do not understand whether the tax code applies to them and taxpayers who know that -- know that it applies to them but believe a provision is invalid. That latter camp, which is clearly where we fall, is a willful violation and would subject us to criminal risks.
