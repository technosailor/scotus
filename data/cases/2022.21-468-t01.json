A state's interest in protecting the health and safety of its residents can support a state law if that local interest is substantial and not outweighed by its effects on commerce. But the state here has taken the position that Proposition 12 does not rest on any scientific determination of such a basis, and Petitioners also plausibly allege that Proposition 12 does not substantially advance such an interest. The judgment of the court of appeals there should be reversed on the basis of Pike. I welcome the Court's questions."
