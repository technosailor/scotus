Our test avoids that result while still leaving ample room for public officials to communicate in their personal capacities. I welcome the Court's questions."

Are you holding yourself out as a public official? And, if so, can the government tell you, if you're going to use your title on your page, as many people do, just make clear you're saying this in your private capacity? And if the government can say that to you consistent with the First Amendment, then you sort of understand that there's not going to be a different First Amendment equation just because we're calling it state action as well."

As this Court addresses the question presented, this Court should adopt the Sixth Circuit's duty and authority or state official test because it complies with this Court's precedent and requires that a government employee is either exercising power possessed by virtue of state law or made possible only because he is clothed with the authority of state law. Petitioner wrongly advocates for an inherently subjective test that divorces the state action inquiry from state law. Petitioner's test will result in uncertainty and self-censorship for this country's government employees despite this Court repeatedly finding that government employees do not lose their rights merely by virtue of public employment. James Freed's Facebook account is the perfect example of the danger of Petitioner's test."

For 12 years, he built up the account to interact with friends, family members, and colleagues to talk about his passions and interests, including his wife, daughter, his dog, his work, and his favorite Bible passages. As he had done for over a decade while operating the account, in 2020, Mr. Freed made a private choice like any other Facebook user could do to block Petitioner and delete Petitioner's comments from the page. After being sued, Mr. Freed deactivated the page and stopped speaking to his family and friends and the public on Facebook because he did not want to lose control over his own speech by the threat of state action. Such self-censorship for government employees will not only have a negative impact on society -- on government employees themselves but as society -- in addition to society as a whole as the voices that may advance knowledge and the search for the truth will be silenced. I welcome the Court's questions."

And so we're trying to get at whether this is an exercise of state power, and, Justice Barrett, we're happy to view this as evidence of that, but we think that the heuristic or the way the Court should look at this set of cases is that state action generally exists in a denial of access to property case, where either the government controls the property, such as an official Facebook page, or a defendant is exercising a duty that itself requires providing access, such as conducting a city council meeting on Facebook Live, or, Justice Jackson, in his backyard, that's something that requires providing access, so that would be something that's an exercise of state power. By contrast, the appearance and content test that my friend on the other side advances imperils the freedom of a government official to speak as a public citizen on matters of public concern."

And that suggests that suddenly he might be subject to constitutional constraints or, if he's having people over for a dinner party, either friends or a kitchen cabinet of informal advisors whose views he shares, if he talks too much about his job, if he identifies himself as a city manager or they know that position, that means that he loses the ability to have those conversations in his private capacity. And that's why we think it's so important to look at what the actual duties of the job were that he was exercising, and just this idea that anytime you're having a conversation with the public, that becomes state action, I think, is a really dangerous idea. And to look specifically at what Mr. Freed's duties were in this case, Justice Kavanaugh, I think different city managers might have different roles."

But it doesn't make sense to have one state action test for access cases online and another state action test for all the other cases, even assuming that we can figure out what denial of access means in the context of all of these different platforms and their various functions. And, second, the test proposed by the United States is an obvious doctrinal mismatch because it relies on cases about the use of private property, which, because it's private property, it has some governmental involvement, but it has to be pretty extraordinary to overcome the very strong default presumption that private property is just not used for state action ever. And for that reason, the government says, essentially, only if you are performing an exclusive public function does it ever count as state action."

Really, it's a dignitary harm that it is someone from the government treating you in a particular way that you should not be treated. And that's, I think, something that gets lost when you don't take account of the fact that he was holding himself out as the city manager, establishing this channel, talking to citizens in that capacity. There are also First Amendment values on the other side of the equation, and we admit that, although, again, we think they're somewhat limited when we're just talking about the channel that you've established and whether you can block access to that channel, as opposed to control over all of your other posts about dogs or other things like that. I think, to a large extent, the other side undercuts their own First Amendment argument when they freely admit that the government as employer could basically tell them to do all of the things that we say they should have done in the first place: namely, establish a second Facebook account where they just talk about their job or, at the very least, if you're going to invoke your title, then make clear when you're talking in your personal capacity and make clear when you're talking in your professional capacity. So, to some extent, they're already undercutting their own First Amendment rights. But we do admit that if you establish a channel as a public official purporting to be a public official, you do lose some amount of control and you will be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. A lot of times, you can still block people for various reasons. But we think that as Justice Scalia put it in his concurrence in Doe versus Reed, criticism is traditionally the price that we have been willing to pay for self-government. Thank you."
