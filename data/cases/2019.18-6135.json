  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Kraig Kahler enjoyed a happy marriage and valued his family for many years. However, in 2008, his marriage began to falter, and his wife began an extramarital affair. By the next year, the formerly happy couple was heading toward divorce, and Kahler allegedly became abusive toward his wife and estranged from their children. Kahler increasingly suffered from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, and though he saw several psychologists and psychiatrists who prescribed antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and sleep aids, he refused to take his medications as directed.</p>\n<p>In November 2009, Kahler went to his wife\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, where his family was visiting, and shot and killed his wife, his two daughters, and the grandmother. Kahler was arrested, charged, and sentenced to death for the four killings. Experts for the defense and the prosecution agreed that Kahler exhibited major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive, borderline, paranoid, and narcissistic personality tendencies. The defense expert testified that, in his opinion, due to Kahler\u2019s mental illness, he did not make the rational choice to kill his family members and indeed had at the time of the shooting temporarily \u201ccompletely lost control.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under Kansas law, a jury cannot consider mental disease or defect as a defense to a crime except insofar as it shows \u201cthat the defendant lacked the mental state required as an element of the offense charged.\u201d In effect, this law makes irrelevant \u201cwhether the defendant is unable to know the nature and quality of his actions or know the difference between right and wrong with respect to his actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>\n",
