Nevertheless, that is the distinction the statute requires us to draw, and we can see that in a few ways. First of all, in Section 1231(a)(7), Congress talks about a situation where the alien has been ordered removed, but removal to any country is impracticable or impossible because all of those countries have refused permission. Even in that context, it's 1231 that applies. That suggests that Congress did view whether and where as distinct. Second, that's the distinction that underlies the difference between withholding of removal on the one hand and asylum on the other hand."

But then I'm looking at (a)(3), which talks about supervision after the 90-day period and says, you know, if the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, defined as 90 days in the statute, it says the alien shall be subject to supervision under the regulations. So why isn't the default that, if it's through the fault of the government or no fault of the noncitizen that removal doesn't take place within the removal period, why isn't the default supervision, rather than, as you suggested to Justice Sotomayor, continued confinement?"

Our point is simply that because these particular aliens have already been removed from the country, have defied their removal orders, and have come back into the country illegally and been caught, there's a particularly strong basis for concluding that those aliens are a flight risk."

Now my friend on the other side says it might not be in most of the cases, but Justice Scalia addressed that in Clark v. Martinez and said, if there's any predictable range of cases that leads to unconstitutional outcomes, that's pretty good evidence that's not the proper construction of the statute if there's a plausible alternative."
