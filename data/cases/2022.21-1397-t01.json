And reason and experience points to the primary purpose test, which has been used, as the discussion this morning indicates, for decades by a huge body of state and federal cases and has been endorsed by commentators from Wigmore to Rice. And I think that body of evidence powerfully rebuts Petitioner's assertion that it's too hard to apply the primary purpose test is what courts have been doing. Instead, Petitioner introduces a so-called freestanding significant purpose test, which, in its reply brief and, again, repeatedly this morning, Petitioner acknowledges is merely a bona fide legal purpose test."

And I guess just to give one real-world example of that, the one court that we view as actually adopting a freestanding significant purpose test is the D.C. Court of Appeals, and in the Moore decision, which we cite on page 30 of our brief, the D.C. Court of Appeals relied on the significant purpose test to overturn a criminal threats conviction for a criminal defendant who in a prior proceeding had told his attorney, his defense counsel that, to paraphrase, he hated the prosecutor and planned to kill her. And the D.C. Court of Appeals looked at that and said, well, no, that doesn't have a primary purpose of getting legal advice, but he was talking to his defense attorney and we think that had a significant legal purpose and took that away from the courts and reversed the conviction on that basis. Now I think that just illustrates the danger of, you know, what is significant is in the eye of the beholder, and once you divorce it from the primary purpose framework, you can get extremely sweeping rulings, both in the criminal context, but also in terms of sweeping in all internal -- all internal communications at companies."
