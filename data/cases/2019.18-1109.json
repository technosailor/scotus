  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>By way of relevant background, James McKinney\u2019s childhood was \u201chorrific\u201d due to poverty, physical and emotional abuse\u2014all detailed in the court filings. Around age 11, he began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and he dropped out of school in the seventh grade. He repeatedly tried to run away from home and was placed in juvenile detention.</p>\n<p>In 1991, when McKinney was 23, he and his half-brother Michael Hedlund committed two burglaries that resulted in two deaths. The state of Arizona tried McKinney and Hedlund before dual juries. McKinney\u2019s jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder (without specifying whether it reached that verdict by finding premeditation or by finding felony murder), and Hedlund\u2019s jury found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p>At McKinney\u2019s capital sentencing hearing (before a judge), a psychologist testified that he had diagnosed McKinney with PTSD \u201cresulting from the horrific childhood McKinney had suffered.\u201d The psychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger McKinney\u2019s childhood trauma and produce \u201cdiminished capacity.\u201d The trial judge credited the psychologist\u2019s testimony, but under Arizona law at the time, the judge was prohibited from considering non-statutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime. Because McKinney\u2019s PTSD was not connected to the burglaries, the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed McKinney\u2019s death sentence on appeal. In 2003, McKinney filed a habeas petition in federal court. The district court denied relief, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and held that the Arizona courts had violated the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-5727\"><em>Eddings v. Oklahoma</em>, 455 U.S. 104 (1982)</a>, by refusing to consider McKinney\u2019s PTSD. In Eddings, the Court held that a sentencer in a death penalty case may not refuse consider any relevant mitigating evidence. A violation of <em>Eddings</em>, the Ninth Circuit held, required resentencing. Thus, the Ninth Circuit remanded to the federal district court to either correct the constitutional error or vacate the sentence and impose a lesser sentence. Arizona moved for independent review of McKinney\u2019s sentence by the Arizona Supreme Court; McKinney opposed the motion on the ground that he was entitled to resentencing by a jury under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2001/01-488\"><em>Ring v. Arizona</em>, 536 U.S. 584 (2002)</a>, which held that juries, rather than judges, must make the findings necessary to impose the death penalty. The Arizona Supreme Court disagreed, finding that McKinney was not entitled to resentencing by a jury because his case was \u2018final\u2019 before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Ring</em>.</p>\n",
  "question": "<ol><li>Was the Arizona Supreme Court required to apply current law, rather than the law as it existed at the time a defendant\u2019s conviction became final, when weighing mitigating and aggravating evidence to determine whether a death sentence is warranted?</li>\n<li>Does the correction of error under <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-5727\"><em>Eddings v. Oklahoma</em>, 455 U.S. 104 (1982)</a>, require resentencing?</li>\n</ol>",
