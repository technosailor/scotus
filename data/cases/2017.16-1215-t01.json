And there's just absolutely no indication that Congress intended to put creditors who are blameless in a situation where the debts created by deceitful debtors are going to be entirely discharged under this rule.

And I didn't hear any explanation as to how their \"related to\" interpretation of \"respecting\" doesn't negate that term as a term of art and term of limitation. The last thing I would say is, if this Court does adopt a new test in this area, and there have been, you know, competing versions of possibilities for this Court, we would urge this Court to vacate the decision below and to remand.
