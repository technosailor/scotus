But there was nothing about that particular statute of limitations that required the government to drop its claims, even if they were outside the three-year window. As an example, the government could -- the IRS could maintain a four-year-old or a five-year-old claim against a bankrupt -- against a bankrupt petitioner, and if the Court ends up not ordering discharge for whatever reason, perhaps there was evidence of fraud, well, those claims, those older claims of the IRS can be maintained and the IRS might even be able to recover on them depending on the size of the estate.

I pointed to the regulation to illustrate the fact that the VA apparently has already assumed that it has such power because extending deadlines for good cause is equitable. You're extending a statutory deadline for good cause, which means you're looking at things that are out -- that are extenuating circumstances. And the VA actually has a body of law that it's already developed to make that determination at the agency level. So I guess my point was the VA apparently has already assumed it has this power."
