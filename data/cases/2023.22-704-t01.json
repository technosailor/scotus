And to -- to point to one instance in which -- though, in which it's important to recognize that copyright registration is a government benefit, one of the requirements you have to satisfy in order to register your copyright is you need to pay a fee to the Copyright Office, and, obviously, that would raise huge First Amendment problems if it was a condition on engaging in the speech. The reason we don't think of it as problematic in the copyright registration program is that it's not a condition on the speech; it's a condition on the benefits that go with federal copyright registration. So the analysis would have to take into account the fact that it's a benefit program, but if the question is can Congress exclude certain types of creative works from copyright protection based on their content, that would be an entirely different question. That would be something that really has no historical analogue, and the Court, in conducting the First Amendment analysis, could take into account constitutional purpose, history, and tradition."

And I guess what I want to ask you is whether you think reasonableness is the same as standard rationality review, because, as I look at the cases, like, reasonableness is definitely not heightened scrutiny, intermediate or strict. But, when the court says we look for reasonableness, it tends to do a couple of things."

And I think a similar analysis would be appropriate here. And I think, once you recognize that even if we're in reasonableness land and most of these other provisions are going to sail through because they're consistent with the history and because they're ultimately just trying to ensure that trademarks function as trademarks and that they don't confuse or mislead consumers, then we're really just talking about one or two provisions that might have a purpose that's wholly disconnected from the purpose of trademark law. And I think what's so unusual about my friend's argument on the other side is that if the test is reasonableness for restrictions that are related to trademark law and the purposes of trademark registration, it's quite anomalous that for purposes that are totally unrelated -- if the test is reasonableness for that, that for -- for unrelated purposes, where Congress is trying to leverage the benefits of -- of trademark registration, you would have a lower standard, rational basis.

We -- we could accept the explanation, and Derek Jeter could still think, I -- I'm offended by the idea of someone with whom I have no connection attempting to profit by linking his own products to my name and my good reputation, and he could worry, if this person can call himself the Derek Jeter of Car Dealers, next there will be the Derek Jeter of Orthodontists and the Derek Jeter of Barbers, and the value of his name will be reduced, will be diluted. And the third scenario is what I might refer to as the true suggestion scenario, where the Los Angeles Lakers describe their product as Jack Nicholson's favorite team or the Chicago Bulls describe their product as Barack Obama's favorite team or a restaurant in which a senator has had dinner uses the slogan Senator X Ate Here. None of those would really be excludable based on the false suggestion clause because they would imply a connection between the living individual and the product, but it would be a connection that actually existed. And so, nevertheless, there is a strong tradition that individuals can exert control over their own names to -- to a degree necessary to prevent those uses from occurring. Now it's true, denial of registration under the Lanham Act doesn't prevent the -- the hypothetical businesses from engaging in those marketing activities."
