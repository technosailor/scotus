But, second, even if there were a fiduciary obligation to use insider information gained in a corporate capacity or to use corporate disclosure channels, the allegations here would still be insufficient.

You're doing exactly what this Court said it couldn't do in Dudenhoeffer, because there is no scienter requirement under ERISA. The law of trusts has never required it for a prudence claim.

All that time, there are people bringing claims against insider fiduciaries for failing to make the kind of disclosures we're talking about. Yet, as far as I can see, there was no difference in the number of insiders who became -- who continued to be appointed as fiduciaries, and there was no diminution in the number of ESOPs that companies decided to have. In fact, if you take that rule that an insider fiduciary, the rule, the Pegram -- although I think it's really a misreading of Pegram -- but the Pegram rule that Mr. Clement is talking about, imagine a situation like the Enron case. The reason there wasn't a viable prudence ERISA claim against the Enron fiduciaries is that they were also insiders who knew that the company was a house of cards, and so they should have acted on that information to protect plan participants. Under Petitioners' rule, the Enron fiduciaries have no ERISA obligation to act on their information about a company like Enron. It doesn't make sense and there's no basis for it. A question, I think it was Justice Breyer, raised earlier as to why it's useful to have insiders as fiduciaries, it's actually because they know the inside information and are, therefore, in a better position to act to protect plan participants. That makes them -- that's an advantage."
