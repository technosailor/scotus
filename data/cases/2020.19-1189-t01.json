And, again, if there were more evidence that this was a problem -- and Respondent does not cite a single example of the sort of gamesmanship that it posits -- then perhaps the Court should take that further step. But, again, as this Court recognized, for instance, in Arthur Andersen in the context of appeals in the arbitration context, sanctions and fee awards paradigmatically would apply in a situation like this where a party is advancing a frivolous argument and doing that for an improper purpose, namely, for the purpose of establishing appellate jurisdiction where there otherwise would not be any. And whether that's a matter of statutory fee-shifting or sanctions, Rule 11 sanctions, or even the use of a court's inherent authority, again, the sanction of dismissal would be available, dismissal of the appeal, and I think that that would suffice to deal with those situations."

And to the extent there's any reasoning at all rather than just citations to other circuit court cases, they're really just about purpose, and even at that, it's quite conclusory.

The Court relied on that land -- that line of cases out of the Federal Circuit and the fact that Congress reenacted not just the same language but added only a new catch-all phrase. And as the Court and the United States' amicus in that case said, that would be an -- an -- a very oblique way of attempting to overturn the settled body of law. The settled body of law comes from what a practitioner looking at nine unanimous circuits over 50 years would think at the time, and that is that where there is a federal officer or civil rights assertion and other issues, the only issue that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review are those issues, and that's what Congress ratified by reenacting the language and only adding \"1442 or.\" There was also -- and -- and -- and we cite to the House report, which -- which points out that the reason for this addition was specifically to protect federal officers from removal, as civil rights cases do because, otherwise, there is no way to get the issue into the court of appeals. So Congress put its thumb on the scales for two issues, federal officer and -- and civil rights, because there were important public policy reasons to protect those kinds of defendants against district court error. In all other cases, Congress has made clear and the courts have consistently held, as has this Court, that the -- if it's a -- if it's a subject matter jurisdiction issue or another ground barred by 1447(c), there is no right to appellate review."

And Respondents' interpretation would have the added consequence of giving the phrase \"order remanding a case\" different meanings in different clauses of the very same statutory sentence. Respondents' only colorable textual argument here is its ratification argument, but, Justice Kavanaugh, this is anything but a classic case for ratification, especially in the absence of any relevant legislative history. As Justice Scalia explained in his opinion for the Court in Alexander versus Sandoval, the relevant inquiry is whether one can \"assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents affirmative congressional approval of the court's statutory interpretation.\" Here, there is simply no reason to believe that Congress was preferring the unreasoned decisions of some courts of appeals construing this statute over the reasoned decisions of this Court construing materially identical ones, particularly given the technical nature of the 2011 amendment. Congress could well have concluded that it wanted plenary review in these cases and that the value of correcting erroneous remands in these specific contexts outweigh the cost of any incremental delay. Justice Thomas, you expressed concern that this could lead to the smuggling in of additional issues on appeal. Of course, under Section 1291, plenary review is the default, not the exception, in our appellate system, but there's no reason to believe that there are going to be a lot of these cases. As the DRI amicus brief notes, in the five years since the Seventh Circuit adopted our interpretation, there have only been six notices of removal citing either of these statutes and only three appeals in those cases. And, again, sanctions and fees are available to deter any abuse."

Our rule would enable courts of appeals to resolve these appeals more efficiently where a court concludes that there is an easier ground for removal than the often fact-intensive federal officer ground, and there would be delay only in a case in which a federal court stays the state court proceedings on remand, which would occur only when the court determined that a defendant is likely to succeed on its appeal. There's, therefore, no good policy reason to override the plain text of Section 1447(d), and because there is plainly federal jurisdiction over these claims, this Court should therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment.
