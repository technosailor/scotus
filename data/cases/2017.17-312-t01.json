And I think it's very hard to imagine a case like Stack about bail claims coming out the same way if every time someone wanted to challenge bail, a denial of bail on appeal, you had to pause the underlying criminal proceedings. There are other differences between the cases that this Court has recognized under the collateral-order doctrine as well. First of all, going to the nature of the right, the right that Respondents have invoked -- and I understand that they've changed their argument a little bit -- but throughout this litigation, they have invoked the right under -- under Deck versus Missouri, which is a right that's grounded in the fairness and accuracy of the underlying proceedings."}, {"start": 1046.08, "stop": 1084.52, "byte_start": 4213419, "byte_stop": 4367123, "text": "That's very different from a bail claim.
