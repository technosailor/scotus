The authority in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that allows a lender, who has a prospective guarantor before him, to look at that guarantor's credit report is a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that says you can pull the credit report of someone who's going to receive an extension of credit in connection with the transaction. And we cite there a 2001 letter from all of the banking regulators that explains in detail why it is reasonable to regard guarantors and other secondary obligors as receiving an extension of credit, and why, in fact, that's essential to the effective administration of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Thank you.",
