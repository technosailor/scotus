If the legislature announces the procedure in advance and gives people the right to vote and they exercise that right, the legislature cannot undo the public's right to vote without violating the right-to-vote line of cases. However, if the legislature acted earlier, say the prior spring, to change the process to give itself the power to appoint electors, not the power in the hands of the people, that's a choice state legislatures could make. In McPherson, it was litigated whether or not a legislature could move from a winner-take-all to a districting system."

First off, on standing, the payment or non-payment of the per diem fee was never before alleged, and any reported non-payment is not in the record. Second, on nominal damages, prior cases like Smith and Bird did not accord standing on nominal damages alone, instead focusing on whether there's an actual personal injury. Second, as to Justice Scalia's important point about congressional remover -- removal in the case of bribery, it's worth noting there is a prescribed removal process for senators, as Justice Alito noted."
