And I'm referring to 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1)(B), and here's what it says: \"Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of age, as prohibited under 633a.\" So it doesn't have any of the language that my friends on the other side rely on. Textually, this is a statute that Congress has enacted that in its text is describing 633a and it uses language that's parallel to the private sector provisions. And I think it's highly relevant to interpreting 633a because as Justice Scalia explained is in -- in his opinion in Branch against Smith, it is \"of course the most rudimentary rule of statutory construction, that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part, including later enacted statutes.\""
