That reading is confirmed by the legislative history, the statute overruled cases that made the Register a gatekeeper to the courthouse, and the policy of the statute, which grants exclusive rights upon fixation of an original work, not by virtue of any administrative action. And as a matter of ordinary language, and in the Copyright Act's lexicon, registration can refer to the copyright owner's effort to secure recordation of a claim and to the Copyright Office's recordation of the claim after examination."

My second answer is that in the rare case -- and I think, frankly, it is rare -- where you would have the imminence and irreparable injury that would warrant a TRO, and you don't fall within one of those exceptions, you can apply for special handling.

We disagree, but we don't think the Court has to go that far. I think it's clear, and he agrees, that it doesn't always mean that in the Act. Section 708(a) refers to -- says that the fees you pay for an application have to cover the cost of the application, including the issuance of a certificate if registration is made. Well, the issue -- a certificate is only issued if registration is made by the register. In the constructive notice provisions in Section 60 -- or, excuse me, 205 and in 406, I think those are also places where he disagrees, but I don't think there's any reasonable reading of those provisions that -- that -- where -- that can come to the conclusion that registration has been made there or a variant thereof.

Well, Section 512 of the Copyright Act discusses secondary liability for online service providers and it provides immunity in certain circumstances. One of those requirements is that you have a take-down regime such that if -- think about YouTube or something like this -- if a copyright owner comes to you and says there's a work on your site that's infringing my copyrights, you have to take it down. And that's not -- does not turn on whether the work is registered or not."

I want to emphasize that our argument relies primarily on the text of Section 411(a) and the fact that it uses the phrase \"registration has been made\" and that in the Act, that phrase and that construction consistently refers to the action of the copyright owner. It's revealing that in the legislative history, which is included in the -- in the codification of the Act, it says that a copyright owner who has not -- who has not registered his claim can have a valid cause of action against someone who has infringed his copyright, but he cannot enforce his rights in the courts until he has made registration. That is -- and, again, in Section 411(b) of the 1976 Act, now 411(c), the copyright owner makes registration. It is a really consistent usage in the statute that when Congress was referring to the action of the copyright owner, it used that phraseology."

And recall that as -- if the time of examination was quite short at the time of the adoption of the Act, that was unlikely to prejudice anyone because registration would -- would come through quickly. And, you know, so it makes perfect sense that the -- in the same way that that is sufficient to protect the rights, to protect the remedies available to the copyright owner, that it is also appropriate to open the court -- the gates of the courthouse. It's surprising to me that the government relies so heavily, by the way, on those constructive notice provisions because copyright -- publication with notice is no longer required under the Act. So this is all -- this is all an issue that would have gone away in 1988 with regard to the notice."

Now it's true that in that case there had been a refusal, and the question was whether mandamus was required, but the same consequences occur in the case of Copyright Office inaction. If there's a circumstance where the Copyright Office does not act, the question is: Can you go to court? And it's inconceivable that Congress would have said in the case of refusal, you can go to court, you don't need to seek a judicial remedy, but in the case of inaction, you can't go to court, and you have to somehow seek a mandamus to get a decision before going to court. It makes all the sense in the world to understand that language to say what it clearly says within the phraseology of the Act, that if the copyright owner has made registration under Section 408(a), that the copyright owner is then entitled to sue. And the -- the conceit that Congress intended to require administrative exhaustion or was concerned about copyright quality, that is -- there's no basis for that in the text of the statute."
