The Fifth Circuit profoundly erred in reading this Court's decision in Bruen to prohibit that widespread common-sense response to the deadly threat of armed domestic violence. Like Heller and McDonald, Bruen recognized that Congress may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens. That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition. Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, individuals with mental illness, felons, and drug addicts. Rahimi offers no historical evidence that those laws were thought to violate the right to keep and bear arms or that the Second Amendment was originally understood to prevent legislatures from disarming dangerous individuals. Despite all that, the Fifth Circuit held that Section 922(g)(8) is facially unconstitutional because the founding generation didn't disarm domestic abusers in particular. But Bruen specifically approved that kind of demand for a historical twin."

And so the reason we haven't invoked them here is because we focused on the more directly relevant laws that apply to those who are indisputably among the people but nevertheless fit within this enduring constitutional principle that the legislature has authority to draw lines and make predictive judgments about those whose access to firearms will create that untenable risk of danger."

The idea, for example, that you can ban firearms in sensitive places, the fact is that the Framers didn't ban firearms in schools even though they existed at the Founding, but the Court has already recognized that those analogues and the historic banning of firearms in places where they present safety concerns can justify a modern-day regulation that does require the banning of weapons in schools. And so too here, I think the Court can identify the constitutional principle, which it's already articulated -- we're not asking the Court to break new ground here -- and say today, Section 922(g)(8) is a clear application of that principle that you can disarm dangerous people. And, Justice Jackson, I do want to push back on the idea and the premise of your question that there was evidence at the Founding, for example, that you couldn't disarm domestic abusers."

But, if what you're suggesting is that there might be a state out there that is ordering judges to enter the subparagraph (c)(2) prohibition without any basis to think that physical force is likely, I think a person would have a very strong due process challenge to that kind of law, and that law would likely be invalidated on the separate basis that it doesn't provide due process if it's requiring courts to enter relief that the facts and the law don't support."

All of that is relevant evidence about the scope of the Second Amendment right, and I think the Court could make clear that it's not a regulation-only test. Second, I think that looking just at regulations themselves, one of the fundamental problems with how courts are applying Bruen is the level of generality at which they're parsing the historical evidence. Court after court has looked at the government's examples and picked them apart to say: Well, taking them one by one, there's a minute -- minute difference between how this regulation operated in 1791 or the ensuing decades and how Section 922 provisions operate today."

And in that kind of context, I think to suggest that the absence of regulation bears substantially on the meaning of the Second Amendment is to take a wrong turn. It's contrary to the situation the Court confronted in Bruen, where there was a lot of historical evidence to say states can't completely prohibit public carry, and against that evidence, you might say that the absence of regulation is significant. But, here, there's nothing on the other side of this interpretive question, and I think that that just shows that you shouldn't hold the absence of a direct regulation against us."

Instead, I think you would look at the factors I was articulating earlier in response to Justice Barrett's question about the evidence before the legislature of dangerousness, the consensus view, whether legislatures routinely think of this circumstance as being dangerous, the breadth of the law, and other factors along those lines."

So we take that as a given when we come to a statute like this, that even if we could show a due process issue with respect to the issuance of the protective order, that would be no defense against the federal prosecution.

Many courts now, several district courts, have credited as-applied challenges to Section 922(g)(1) by armed career criminals who have multiple convictions for aggravated assault, drug trafficking, armed robbery, clearly violent crimes, because we don't have a sufficient historical analogue disarming those subject to precisely those crimes at the Founding."
