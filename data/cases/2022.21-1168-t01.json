I would think that would be the unfair, problematic, potentially unconstitutional reaching out to grab corporations, but, to the extent that the corporation, as you say, is agreeing voluntarily, knowingly, to do business in the state, I would think the state would have a very significant interest in making sure that its residents have a forum to bring their lawsuits.

If somebody wants to -- wants to ship duck decoys from Maine into Pennsylvania, hasn't even done it yet but, nevertheless, decides out of -- out -- you know, out of an abundance of caution I'm going to register to do business in the State of Pennsylvania, what you're saying is, under those circumstances, you have consented to being sued on actions that have nothing to do with Pennsylvania and, indeed, in circumstances where you have not even done any business in the State of Pennsylvania. And my friend's argument on the other side of that is to say: Yes, but Pennsylvania has this enormous interest in allowing everyone to access its courts and that that -- you know, which is fine, except, first of all, in defense of this litigation, the State of Pennsylvania didn't defend this statute. And, second of all, no other state has adopted a statute like this one for the -- at -- at any time within the modern memory of people. And so, therefore, this state -- this statutory scheme stands alone. So, to answer Justice Kavanaugh's question, is it alone? Yes. And if this Court affirms the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the only effect of that will be to end a statute that the State of Pennsylvania doesn't care about and that no other state has come here to defend under these circumstances."
