The other side has a tendency to invoke the phrase \"statute of repose,\" which isn't really self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I would just start with the text, and it begins, \"no action\" -- and action is going to be the important noun here. \"No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 11 unless brought\" -- and that's going to be the operative thing that has to happen -- \"within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\" The three-year period will follow in the next sentence, but we can pause here for just a second because it teaches a lot. We know that American Pipe tolling applies to this sentence, and therefore, we know a few things, and it's conceded and everyone agrees. The action is brought on --",

And what this Court held, at least as I read American Pipe, is that we know that was a statute of limitations because it was subject to tolling in at least one circumstance. And what this Court said in the Wallberger case, of course, is, when you have a time limit that's subject to tolling, that's a hint that it's a statute of limitations because the defining feature of a statute of repose that makes it different from a statute of limitations is that it's not subject to tolling or estoppel. And since American Pipe was emphatically a rule of tolling, the Court used the word \"tolling rule,\" \"toll,\" \"tolling\" at least a dozen times in the opinion. That tolling rule simply does not apply to a statute of repose like Section 13. And I think --",

And as this Court said in Waldburger, in talking about equitable tolling, two of the classic situations for equitable tolling are categorical rules: infancy and, essentially, lack of mental competence. Those are two equitable rules for when a statute of limitations are tolled, and they're equitable rules. I think the equitable rule that this Court established in American Pipe, and why it was right on two occasions to refer to it as a rule of equitable tolling is that, if you were a member of a timely commenced class action, you have an equitable basis to toll the statute of limitations. I think it's as simple as that.",
