To begin with, the IIU exclusivity regulation that we discussed at page 17 of the red brief made quite clear at the time of this incident that the IIU had exclusive authority whenever there was a referral that was made to the IIU at that point and that no other agency could proceed. That, again, has nothing to do with the lodging material and, I think, makes quite clear that the ARP was not the proper place to go. We have the additional briefs, which we think are on somewhat different footing than some of the -- the other agency materials, and we have the 2008 directive that did happen after the case but made quite clear that the ARP is simply the not -- not the correct place for these cases to go.

So I think that our view is quite clear that if Maryland's system in this case were endorsed, that would become a very clear model for what other prisons could enact, this sort of upside-down system, where you're told you have to go to the ARP process to properly exhaust, but once you get there, you're told that you've absolutely come to the wrong place and, despite any guidance, you have to somehow know that you need to appeal, contrary to the instructions that you're being given, in order to properly exhaust your claim.
