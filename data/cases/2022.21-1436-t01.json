First, unlike several of its neighboring provisions, the exhaustion requirement in 1252(d)(1) does not contain the requisite clear statement to render it jurisdictional. Second, and regardless, any issue preservation requirement is not statutory and thus not jurisdictional, and that is especially so since the government's rule is not normal issue preservation, where issues must be raised before a decision, but, rather, a super-strong rule where a litigant must, in some poorly defined category of cases, request post-decision reconsideration. Third, because a motion to reconsider is not a remedy available as of right, a non-citizen does not need to file such a motion to properly exhaust. I'd like to start with this last point, which has tremendous practical implications, and if we are right the Petitioner properly exhausted, she prevails regardless of (d)(1)'s jurisdictional status. The government correctly concedes that a non-citizen need not normally file a motion to reconsider."

By contrast, the INA expressly requires administrative exhaustion in a highly adversarial system where non-citizens have long been required to identify errors for review. Petitioner can't explain why Congress would codify the doctrine of administrative exhaustion but leave out this essential requirement. The Court should reject Petitioner's approach and hold that non-citizens cannot forego available agency procedures to raise issues in federal court in the first instance. Here, where the Board allegedly introduced a new error, that means filing a motion to reconsider. Petitioner's fail to do -- failure to do so forecloses judicial review. I welcome the Court's questions."

So I'd like to start with (d)(1), the \"as of right,\" because this does come up an awful lot, and I think the Court's guidance would be helpful. As to \"as of right,\" we just don't think the government has any role for that statutory text that isn't already captured by the separate term \"available.\" And in many exhaustion provisions, Congress spoke about available remedies, but, here, Congress added more, added \"as of right,\" and we think that statutory language has to have a purpose, and only Petitioner gives that language meaning. Next, the government, in order to try to escape the result that their textual interpretation would lead, that every non-citizen always has to file a motion to reconsider, I heard the textual argument that it -- that their -- their retort is that a motion to reconsider would be improper in the event that the Board has already resolved or decided that issue. But that just can't be right because a motion to reconsider, as the name implies, \"reconsider,\" the classic use of that is to go back to the Board and say, well, you decided this thing, this issue of fact or this issue of law, but we think the thing that you decided you got wrong."

So I don't think it works for the government to suggest that a motion to reconsider when you are just straightforwardly asking the Board to reconsider what it already did is somehow procedurally improper such that that becomes a textual escape from the place that their statutory argument would ultimately lead. As to the jurisdictional status of (d)(1), we do think the Court has plainly adopted the clear statement rule, and for all of the reasons we've discussed, this just doesn't satisfy it and certainly not the issue preservation requirement that the government requires."
