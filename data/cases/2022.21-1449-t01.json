So, if the complaint alleges clearly unprotected conduct and the only issue is whether those allegations are true, the state court gets first crack at resolving the facts. That's probably why in this very case the regional director didn't even file his complaint until after the Washington Supreme Court's decision, instead of at the outset, which, under the union's view, would have prevented four years of wasteful litigation. The Court should therefore reverse the decision below and allow the state courts to adjudicate Glacier's non-preempted state court complaint. And I'd be happy to address any questions Your Honors may have."

I thought -- I thought that this is a spectrum that when it comes to the state court and the state court is asked to stand down, we have preemption, instead of having to litigate the whole issue and get to make the determination about whether the conduct is actually protected, the state court can look at it and say: Well, it looks arguable, and so that's enough. If I'm right about that, I'm still confused as to why an intervening Board determination that we have protected conduct here would be irrelevant to the state's assessment of whether or not there's arguably protected conduct --"
