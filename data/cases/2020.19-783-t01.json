But, as I was trying to say earlier, Justice Sotomayor, the core of the problem is there is no foothold in the statute to inch the statute forward to cover the conduct in this case without also covering all kinds of other violations of purpose-based restrictions that could appear in terms of service contracts, employee handbooks, course syllabuses, syllabi at universities, or even oral dictates. So just take -- go back to the facts of this case and imagine Mr. Van Buren's supervisor had told him, please don't do any license plate searches this evening until you've finished your paperwork, or tomorrow, when you're out on patrol --"

So you have this cascade of contract-based restrictions, employee handbook restrictions, course syllabus restrictions, oral restrictions, all the other things that could -- that can directly restrict the scope of use in a way that, even as Justice Kavanaugh imagined, if the reader knew, if the user knew that that violated the statute, and that would be just the vast sweeping criminal law that would bring the over-criminalization concerns this Court has had over the last several years really home to roost in just one single statute."

If that's a statute that's aimed at insiders who are people trusted to get into the warehouse who do obtain the items in -- in ways that they're not supposed to obtain, then I don't think we'd -- we think it would be covering these -- these other kinds of scenarios. If I were to tell you that -- if I were to talk about a statute where somebody steps on a ladder and uses such step to retrieve an item, you'd think it was an item that the person couldn't get without stepping on the ladder and using the ladder, not an item that was easily reachable from the ground."

But even as to the plain meaning of the term that Mr. Feigin proposes, it just escapes me why logging into your work computer does not establish authorization or logging into your Westlaw account or satisfying an age-based restriction on Facebook or being single and therefore being authorized to use a dating website, et cetera, et cetera. All of these websites and work computers are accessed only with authorization, as even Mr. Feigin defines the term, and so that doesn't meaningfully narrow the statute. And then I think what you're left with is this problem about consequences."

What the Court has done in every one of those cases is apply the traditional tools of construction to say any ambiguity in the statute must be construed narrowly because of fair notice and other -- federalism and related principles. So, for those reasons, we'd ask the Court -- ask the Court to reverse."
