And our response to that argument was twofold: first, to say that that's just a misreading of the state law here, it doesn't apply directly to plans, but, more importantly, secondly, that even if it did, it wouldn't matter because, at the end of the day, pharmacy reimbursement just isn't a central matter of plan administration."

If that -- if that were what the law said, and this is in many, many ways not, whether or not it would be preempted would require this Court to decide the two questions that it reserved in Travelers itself. The first, which is the last sentence of Footnote 4, explain that the Court did not address the surcharge statute insofar as it applied to self-insured plans. And the second, as my friend mentioned, is that if the state law produced economic effects as to force the ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of coverage, it would, indeed, be preempted."

And it requires, I'm sure, pretty complicated computer programs, and -- and that's why, apparently, there are so few of these PBMs. It requires a pretty sophisticated entity to deal with this situation at all.

Circuit pointed out in its PCMA decision, which both parties -- all parties are citing, the -- the -- this complexity of providing American workers with pharmacy benefits is tremendous, and that's why, as a practical matter, they have to use third-party administrators to do this. The fact that they have third-party administrators which allow them to provide these kind of benefits on a price-efficient basis doesn't mean that -- that ERISA permits every individual state to add additional levels of complexity. And if you just look at just the requirements for the 40 different tests and schedules for updating MAC lists and what price consequences to plans and beneficiaries every update to the MAC list has, it's -- it's an immense complication, and it affects the benefits that beneficiaries receive. Similarly, the remedies that vary from one state or other imposing on plans that very often are natural -- national plans mean that employees of the same company will have unequal benefits from one state to another and plans will have to have -- either plans themselves or using the third-party administrators that they have appointed as agents to administer the plan on their behalf -- different procedures and different remedies and different update schedules in every different state, which themselves frequently change. And many, many of these requirements will turn -- will require the plans to either change their summary plan of benefits, their explanation of benefits when it turns out that the beneficiary has to pay more in Mississippi because of some requirement that applies after an appeal procedure, or to tell people, for example, look, you're a driver for J.B. Hunt, but, if you try to fill your prescription in Arkansas, even though we have promised you that you can fill that prescription at this pharmacy with this coinsurance or copay obligation, you have to understand that that pharmacy has the right to refuse to give you that benefit."

And even PCMA doesn't claim that those laws would be preempted, even though it would have the same effect. And -- and, lastly, to -- to end on a question that Justice Gorsuch asked, which is about the limiting principle, I think that's really the problem with PCMA's argument. There's no limiting principle. If you accept their position that cost -- anytime a regulation imposes cost, that can lead to preemption because it might affect the benefits calculation, that really has no limiting principle. You would, frankly, preempt things like state minimum wage laws that have exactly that same effect."
