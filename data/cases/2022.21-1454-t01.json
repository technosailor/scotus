If Congress had really given the Authority this power, if it had really wanted a federal independent agency with jurisdiction over federal labor relations to issue orders to state guards, it would not have made the grant of that power so hard to find. Ultimately, here, there's no reason to resist the statute's plain meaning. Dual-status technicians are employees of the Defense Department, and they should enforce their labor rights through and against that department. I welcome your questions."

Let me explain how that makes sense. If you step back and you ask who's best positioned to handle all this, the Authority in the first instance or the Department, the Department on the front end is the only entity that can bring all the interests to the table. So, when they're negotiating or trying to amicably work out a dispute, they, unlike the Authority, are subject to presidential control, and so they can ensure that the President's commander-in-chief powers aren't frustrated. They have immense influence over the guards and the Adjutants General. But most important of all, the technicians are Defense Department employees. The Defense Department signs their checks."

We're not just in the first instance making policy determinations about how this thing should be structured. And as Justice Kavanaugh just pointed out, we have a statute that gives these people, the dual-service technicians, collective bargaining rights that in the collective bargaining world, as Justice Kagan points out, it means the right to sit across the table from the people who hire and fire you and bargain over the terms and conditions of your employment. So I guess your task in my view is to establish why it is that Congress would have intended to carve you out in this situation."
