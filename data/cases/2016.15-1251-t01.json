But given Your Honor's textural point only for the moment, I do think that's exactly what this Court held in Preseault, in -- in -- where there was a \"notwithstanding\" clause, that said, notwithstanding the provisions of the Act, funds -- that you have to rely on advance appropriations, and this Court said, no, that doesn't override the existence of the Tucker Act. I point the Court as well to the case cited in our brief, SEC v. Mount Vernon Memorial Park, which is a situation extremely similar to this, if I could just take a sec on that because I think it will help. That was an interpretation of the Investment Company Act, and it said, \"An investment company is an issuer who meets one of the following: (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).\" And for (a)(3), there was something called a (b)(1) limitation, and it said \"Notwithstanding (a)(3), an issuer is\" -- \"you're not an issuer unless you're in the business of issuing securities.\" And what the Court said was that the issuer who fell within that limitation, the same (b)(1) limitation, nonetheless was an investment company under (a)(2) precisely because the introductory limitation was limited to notwithstanding (a)(3), and that case is cited in our brief.",

In that situation it would be clear that \"person\" and \"section\" would make (b)(1) applicable to (a)(2) and (a)(3). There would be a question in that situation, though, whether (b)(1) also applied to (a)(1), first of all, because of the starkness of the conflict between (a)(1) and (b)(1), and second of all, the government argues that the general versus specific canon would apply there, but it wouldn't necessarily because the general versus specific canon is typically invoked in order to avoid superfluity where you have one general provision and a specific provision that would be meaningless if not read as an exception to the general. Here, however, in -- in the hypothetical statute without the \"notwithstanding\" clause, you wouldn't have superfluity concern because (b)(1) would apply to (a)(2) and (a)(3)",
