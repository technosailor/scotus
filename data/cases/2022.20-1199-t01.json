And for competitive applicants, checking the right racial box is an anvil on the admissions scale, worth the same as ultra rare achievements like winning a national championship.

Student body diversity makes our businesses more innovative and globally competitive, our scientists more creative, our medical professionals more effective, and our military more cohesive. Experience has more than borne out Justice Powell's observation that our future as a country depends on having leaders who have enjoyed wide exposure to students as diverse as the nation itself. And so, as this Court has consistently held, if necessary to achieve genuine diversity, a university need not blind itself to race, which like the type of high school an applicant attended, their socioeconomic and family background or the part of the country they live in, forms a part of who they are. Now SFFA attempts to use Harvard's admissions program as some sort of proof that settled constitutional precedent is egregiously wrong, but while SFFA is fully entitled to its own legal arguments, it is not entitled to its own facts. Following exhaustive discovery in this case, the trial court considered the testimony of 30 witnesses and detailed expert analysis and made extensive meticulous findings which the court of appeals robustly affirmed, and those findings, applying strict scrutiny, are that Harvard does not improperly emphasize race in its admissions decisions, it does not engage in racial balancing, it most certainly does not discriminate against Asian American applicants, and it does not yet have a current workable race-neutral alternative. The false narrative to which SFFA clings is no basis to dismantle decades of precedent confirming the constitutionality of limited race consciousness in admissions. And I very much welcome the Court's questions."

But, as to your point about race-neutral alternatives -- and I -- correct me if I'm wrong, Justice Thomas, but I think this is what you're asking me about -- we have exquisitely detailed metrics in this case with respect to race-neutral alternatives and findings and testimony with respect to the so-called ALDCs, which is an acronym that I think I was present -- I was actually literally present at the birth of, which is a preference for children of alumni, children of faculty, and staff, athletes, and other people who have found themselves on the dean's interest list. This -- the data in this case shows that if that -- if race were eliminated, you couldn't consider race, and you also could give none of those preferences, the racial diversity of the matriculating class would go down."

Now it is no -- there's no doubt, and Harvard acknowledges and is ashamed, that in 1920, one of its presidents, President Lowell, decided that there were too many Jews and that they were then going to start asking questions on the application that would allow them to take into effect character. The notion that that bears at all on the way that Harvard's current admissions process, which uses a 40-person admissions committee that meets and decides each application en banc, in discussion, has any resemblance whatsoever to the racist, anti-Semitic policy of a single Harvard president is insubstantial, as the courts found."

And in terms of -- I don't know if this is the first part of your question, but Harvard is actually attempting -- is measuring how it is doing in terms of diversity and the benefits of diversity and what needs to be done and what other things can be done in a race-neutral way on a very regular basis.

With respect to California and Michigan in particular, since your question referred to them, I would point the Court to the amicus brief filed by those university systems in those states, which have explained that, actually, they have struggled, despite implementing any number of race-neutral alternatives, to actually see true diversity across all of their campuses, including their most selective campuses. And University of California in particular points to Berkeley and UCLA as places where there have been these dramatic declines in diversity, racial diversity, on campus."

There is a world of difference between the situation this Court confronted in Brown, the separate but equal doctrine that was designed to exclude African Americans based on notions of racial inferiority and subjugate them, which, as this Court recognized, the school children affected their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone, a world of difference between that and the university policies at issue in this case, which are not intended to exclude anyone on the basis of race or -- or even to benefit particular racial groups on the basis of race but, rather, are designed to bring individuals of all races together so that they can all learn together and benefit from that diverse educational environment. And I think it is profoundly ahistorical to say, as Petitioners do, that those situations are precisely equivalent, and it also trivializes the grievous moral and legal wrongs of state-sponsored segregation and the enormous harms that millions of Americans suffered under it."
