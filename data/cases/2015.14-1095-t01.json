It said, \"The term\" -- it says, \"The term 'exceeds authorized access' means to access a computer with authorization and then to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled so to obtain.\" So if there were a circumstance in which there was no authorization in the first place to -- to access the computer, I think we would be in trouble. But we would, of course, have the other -- the other way of -- of proving that the statute had been violated, which was the unauthorized access charge.
