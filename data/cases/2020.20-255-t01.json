But I think the flip side is off-campus speech has a much greater tendency now than it did then to affect the operations of the school simply because it can be made available to a vast audience, not with respect to -- with respect to the chat -- the Snap that's different, but a lot of online speech will literally occur -- appear on students' phones when they're back in class and at the next school day. So I -- I don't think it would be untoward for the Court to take account of that potential effect of off-campus speech in deciding what the constitutional rule should be."

We've been discussing the school speech cases as -- as though they were a doctrinal island, but I think it is worth pointing out that school speech is only one context in which participants in government programs can be made to accept speech restrictions that couldn't be imposed on the general public. So, if I, for example, posted a message online that tracked the text of B.L.'s Snap, but, instead of \"school,\" \"softball,\" and \"cheer,\" I put \"DOJ,\" \"law,\" and \"the Supreme Court,\" that would be constitutionally protected speech. The DOJ, as my employer, could certainly take the position that that was inconsistent with my job as a DOJ attorney, and that would rest in part on the fact that my employment at DOJ is -- is voluntary on my part, but it would also rest on the fact that communications like that would have a much greater disruptive tendency coming from within the Department than from the outside."
