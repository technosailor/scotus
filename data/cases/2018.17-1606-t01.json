Our point is simply that the government certainly, for example, could waive the question whether the Petitioner had exhausted his administrative remedies, and if it did waive that question, surely, the district court would have the authority to move on to the merits of the case, just as it would if it found that some equitable exception to exhaustion had applied, as the Court did in Eldridge and City of Bowen."

Each of the words, a final decision of the Commissioner made after a hearing, and especially those last four words, needs to be read together, rather than in isolation, because each word qualifies and modifies the kind of action in question. In SSI cases like this one under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, Section 405(g) guarantees judicial review only for disputes over the eligibility or the amount of welfare benefits, the matters on which the Social Security Act itself requires a hearing and a final determination, not on procedures afforded under the agency's regulations. So the key words to start with, I think, are the ones that the Chief Justice, Justice Kagan, and Justice Breyer have all asked about, which are \"after a hearing.\" And I think that the parties' interpretation comes perilously close to reading -- either reading the words out of the statute or reading them so that there isn't really any plausible relationship between the decision and the -- and the \"after a hearing\" requirement. And I think, actually, Congress chose those words carefully and they meant there to be a relationship."
