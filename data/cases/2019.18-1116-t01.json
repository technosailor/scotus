Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute."

Given that real-world understanding, I think it's perfectly sensible that Congress decided not to start the three-year clock running the moment a participant receives these disclosures. And -- and I want to emphasize this, I think it's all the more true because a general six-year period does provide a concrete cutoff for most breach of fiduciary duty claims, and that six-year cutoff is among the shortest general limitations period in ERISA. With Section 1113, Congress set an important balance."

So my question is -- you've probably looked into this, maybe not any more, but I'd hoped you'd looked into it, and is there anything in that history that says that that's what we want, we want six-year statutes of limitations for bad investment decisions, but we'll take three-year statutes where he was, for example, and then you have the six examples you gave."

                "text": "So I think that is a nice and perhaps clever theory, but it's demonstrably wrong, and here's why: If you look at the original version of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1021 of the 1974 act, and it's this provision that governed those disclosures that needed to be sent to participants and those disclosures that needed to be sent to the Department of Labor, it was in effect all the way up through the 1987 amendments, those documents that were required to be sent to participants, including the SPD and a statement of the plan's assets and liabilities, were among -- were all among the documents that were also being sent to the Department of Labor. So, under the pre-amendment version, even if you kind of think maybe Congress was doing something funky with actual knowledge, participants were, in fact, charged with constructive knowledge of all the documents that ERISA required fiduciaries to send to them in exactly the same way as the Department of Labor was -- had constructive knowledge of the documents that were being provided to it. So there's no gap between the constructive knowledge trigger for those documents provided to participants and those that are provided to the Department of Labor. And I think, you know, what we can see, given that, is that, you know, although there's no legislative history, we do have this D.C. Circuit opinion called Fink, which the court issued about a year before the 1987 amendments, and -- and what they said -- what the court said in Fink is, look, these documents that are being filed with the Department of Labor, they're complex, they're complicated, it's even hard for the Department to -- to -- to get on top of everything that's going on here. To have the clock running on this three-year exception based just on the filing of these documents doesn't seem to us to make very good sense. And shortly after that opinion, what happens? Congress amends the statute to take out that constructive knowledge trigger."

And I think, if you think about that for a minute, that blows up their whole theory of the statute, because what they're saying is in 1974 Congress enacted a statute that was actually quite harsh, that the default was going to be a three-year statute of limitations if the information sufficient to show breach was sent to DOL whether you got it or not. It would actually be the odd case that was the six years under that theory, not the normal case. And -- and, of course, when Congress amended the statute in 1987, it did not change the words \"had actual knowledge.\" So the meaning you're trying to ascertain is the meaning that those words had in 1974. And so I -- I just think that their whole -- the whole theory, nobody reads as a -- you know, that's all blown up by their -- what they said about what happened in 1974. Now the second point, if I could, with respect to the -- the -- Justice Breyer, you asked about consequences and there was a robust discussion about the class action impact here. I -- I do think what my friends on the other side are saying essentially is that -- they didn't put it exactly this way, they spoke at a higher level of abstraction -- but, basically, what they're saying is here's what will happen in class actions."

Just think of what a catastrophe that's going to be in the class action context. So, in the unlikely event that this Court disagrees with our position on the merits, I would hope that there would be clarity here as to how this -- this reading will play out in a class action context, because that would be a staggering, enormous negative consequence. After all, it does put the cart before the horse because statute of limitations is a threshold defense."
