That's exactly what this -- Chief Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court in Milwaukee, and it's what happened in this case and is what ought to happen in this case. Now, as to Townsend, Townsend is very much not to the contrary because it is -- it involved maintenance and cure, rather than unseaworthiness, and that makes a tremendous difference in several dimensions.

And that policy point is quite important in these particular cases because, even though these situations are extremely rare, the cases have always talked about the availability of exemplary damages.

That principle expanded during the 1800s through decisions in Great Britain to allow for compensation for the injury to the sea worker as a result of the unseaworthiness condition.

And so, by the time of the Osceola in 1903, this Court said it is well settled by the decisions of the lower courts that a -- an injured worker from an unseaworthiness condition can obtain compensation both for the unseaworthiness of the vessel, as well as for a failure to provide maintenance and cure.

Justice Breyer, with respect to the laundry list of little things that are different, it's not our contention -- there is no question that even in 1920, in the 1920s, this Court repeatedly said that these are -- that the Jones Act is an alternative remedy for loss resulting from wrongfully-caused injury. And now -- nowadays, I cannot think of a case, and no one has cited one, in which you could get a recovery under the Jones Act but not for unseaworthiness. These specific differences between the two were well-known to the Court in Miles. They were well-known to the Court in Peterson and all the other cases that have said that the two are substitutes for each other. On the other hand, vis-a-vis maintenance and cure, the notion that, well, because there could be cases where there is injury suffered after and as a result of a failure to undertake the humane duty of maintenance and cure and that could be brought under the Jones Act, well, they both overlap. Consider this: In its very first decision after the Jones Act was enacted, in the Baltimore Steamship case and then again in Peterson, this Court explained that res judicata applies as between a Jones Act cause of action and an unseaworthiness cause of action that is not true with respect to maintenance and cure. For that reason, a Jones Act claim and a unseaworthiness claim must be brought at the same time, emphatically not true for maintenance and cure. The Court has held that the three-year statute of limitations for causes of action under general maritime law applies to maintenance and cure. But, following enactment of the Jones Act, can no longer be applied to unseaworthiness because they are cognate causes of action for the same injury, and, therefore, the shorter statute of limitations under the Jones Act governs. The evidence -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, the evidence of punitive damages in unseaworthiness cases, with all due respect, is not slim."
