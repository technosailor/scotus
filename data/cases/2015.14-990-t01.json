                "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 2284(a) states in plain terms that a district court of three judges shall be convened when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts. Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a three-judge court when the circumstances identified in 2284 are satisfied. It -- it reads, quote, \"Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges.\" Now, although that language did not appear in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more than a congressional recognition and codification of what was then by settled -- what was by then settled practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that the litigants then would have to file a request for a three-judge district court, and in turn that the single judge would have to determine whether three judges were, in fact, required. Now, at the time that Congress enacted that long-standing practice in the 1976 amendments to the Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one basis upon which three judges are, quote, \"not required\" is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial. Congress is presumed to have been aware of -- of this Court's precedents so holding, and in the absence of a contrary indication -- and here there is none -- to have intended that interpretation of the words \"not required\" to be incorporated into the statute.",
