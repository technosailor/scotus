And so it's abundantly clear in those e-mails, even in the e-mail suggesting that the transmittal letter could be signed by autopen, it's very clear that the Services understood themselves to still be working on draft biological opinions, and they had committed previously to sharing a draft with the EPA. So even if they had transmitted that draft or transmitted those documents, they -- they understood themselves to be transmitting a draft that did not yet represent a final decision. With respect to Your Honor's first question, the lower courts have understood this Court's precedent on the deliberative process privilege to require that a document be both predecisional and deliberative in order to qualify for the privileges. We're not taking issue with that."

Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in -- in FOIA cases. So that raises the concern that the effects-based test or looking at the effects of the memo could become so fact-intensive and could really blur the longstanding predecisional principle of the deliberative process privilege because lots of drafts have -- have real effects within the executive branch.

Those decisions are enormously consequential not just to the action agency or to the Sierra Club but to the regulated parties who ultimately have to comply with the measures the Services demand. The importance of looking to those legal consequences, rather than just labels, is that it tracks FOIA's core concern, making sure the public knows how agencies are actually using the authority Congress gave them.

Now, turning to Respondent's alternative, first, Respondent really this morning has made no effort to defend the actual reasoning of the court of appeals. Respondent does not defend the kind of last version rationale that the court of appeals employed to conclude that the December 2013 draft biological opinions were -- were not predecisional and deliberative. Respondent's alternative instead is this appreciable legal consequences test, which I don't think works for a number of reasons. First of all, as -- as -- as Justice Barrett's questioning illustrated, there -- there is no appreciable legal consequence to a draft biological opinion."

Second, as Justice Kagan's hypothetical illustrated, the appreciable legal consequences test that Respondent has proposed here really proves too much because the same -- the same consequences that Respondent is relying on here could have flowed from, for example, an informal recommendation made by a subordinate staff member at one of the Services. You know, we use -- we use this example in our reply brief that, if a junior staffer at one of the Services had sent an e-mail to the EPA at the very outset of the consultation saying: Well, in my view, my supervisors might make a jeopardy determination here unless you change the following things about your proposed rule, no one would confuse that with a final decision. Respondent's -- Respondent's only real answer to those problems is to insist that in this particular consultation, the Services, in fact, made a decision in December 2013. And that contention is just at odds with the record of the proceedings here."
