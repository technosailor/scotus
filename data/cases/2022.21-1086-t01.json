So what -- what is the problem?

I thought you were saying Gingles Step 1 needs to be retooled to require some showing of a comparison with a race-neutral -- or, excuse me, a race-blind algorithm. And so then my question was: Okay, well, you would bear the burden, I think, of showing that there's a problem with the way that we're doing it now, that -- the way that Gingles is working, and that a race-blind algorithm actually produces a better result insofar as it's better implementing what Congress intended or it is required by the Constitution.

And I think, in a single member districting contest -- context, it's especially important that the Court be putting those legitimate goals front and center for at least two reasons. First, as this Court has said in every redistricting opinion that you've issued, redistricting is one of the most difficult and complex things that a legislature has to undertake and it's an area where courts are not particularly well-suited to come in and second-guess. But second and even more importantly, single member districting is uniquely zero sum. So, if someone brings a challenge to an early voting period and says it's 10 days but really should be 20 and they prevail and get 10 more days, no one is harmed on account of race. The minority voters who prevailed and the majority voters can both take advantage of that. Similarly, if you challenge multi-member districts and you replace them with neutral single-member districts, no one's worse off on account of race. But, if you have a neutral plan and someone comes in and upsets it to racially gerrymander it in favor of one racial group, well, necessarily you're going to be harming some other group on account of race."

So you -- you -- you can look at either as the problem is race predominance or the problem is you can't maintain -- you can't account -- properly account for traditional districting principles if you treat race as one of those principles and necessarily force the other ones to yield, but I think it's six in one hand, half a dozen in the other."

And -- and what I guess I'm a little confused about in light of that argument is why, given our normal assessment of the Constitution, why is it that you think that there's a Fourteenth Amendment problem? And let me just clarify what I mean by that. I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way. That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that \"unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen.\" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy."

In other words, it seems as though some of my colleagues are asking the question if -- you know, if you have a million maps and you can generate a million maps, why shouldn't we require that one map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And I actually think the question is, why should we require at Gingles Step 1 that a map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And there are two possibilities, right? It's -- one possibility is because that's what Congress would have wanted, but when I read Section 2, I don't see that Congress is requiring race neutrality.

Instead, Alabama is asking the Court to radically change the law by inserting this concept of race neutrality and effectively limiting Section 2 to intentional discrimination. That approach would delete the text that Congress added in 1982 to cover results. It disregards nearly four decades of this Court's precedent, and it would have drastic real-world consequences. Under the state's approach, nothing would stop Alabama and many other states from dismantling their existing majority-minority districts, leaving black voters and entire swaths of the country with no ability to elect their preferred representatives. The Court should reject that destabilizing and atextual interpretation of Section 2. I'd like to turn if I could to the questions that Justice Barrett and Justice Jackson were just asking about the narrower form of Alabama's argument and specifically whether it makes sense to put plaintiffs to the burden of showing that they can draw their maps in a race-neutral way. And I think the problem with that approach is that it's contrary to the text, would be unworkable in practice, and it also is unnecessary to address the concern Alabama's raising about unconstitutional districts. So if I could just unpack that a little bit."

And the question I would think from the standpoint of predominance would be, is the consideration of that one additional factor, which would necessarily produce different maps because, if you change one small part of an algorithm, you would see that you might have different results. So, fine, we have different results because the experts use 51 criteria and the computer used 50, but the question I think is whether just the use of that extra one, because it differentiates, means that it predominates.

So I think that's Exhibit A of the principle here. And far from disrupting or disturbing the Gingles framework in any way, Congress has repeatedly left Section 2 untouched while it's amended other aspects of the statute. And in the 2006 amendments, the House report specifically noted that Congress did not intend any departure from Gingles or its progeny. So I think that those stare decisis considerations really weigh heavily in the balance here."
