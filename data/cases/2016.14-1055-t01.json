We think there is a plausible story for why Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if you don't find that explanation completely satisfying, the text of the statute should control. The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the Federal courts. In this case, the Court should give Congress the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal 'court of competent jurisdiction,'\" then that means that you have to look to some other provision of law to see if that court is vested with jurisdiction.",

In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal jurisdiction citing cases. In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before our statute was decided, it said that in that context, the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. So I think the only way to harmonize all of these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross language/Osborn/D'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally means: personal jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction, et cetera.",
