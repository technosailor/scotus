And the Second Circuit relies on Porter, relies on Mitchell, relies on all the old cases that you say are distinguishable, and -- and said yes, an injunction includes restitution according to Supreme Court law on the subject.

And neither statute in Porter or Mitchell provided the very same monetary relief in a separate provision -- here, that's Section 19 -- subject to various protections like a statute of limitations that would be rendered entirely meaningless if the Commission could implicitly get the same relief under 13(b) instead. So Porter and Mitchell are entirely distinguishable based on the statutory scheme."
