That is -- that is unmistakably incorrect. If you examine the legislative record that preceded the REAL ID Act, what Congress understood itself to be doing was softening or limiting the scope of the criminal alien jurisdictional bar in order to solve the problems that this Court identified in St. Cyr. So Congress fixed the problem, as it were, by permitting review of legal claims and constitutional claims for criminal aliens and then amending 1252 in numerous places to make clear that there would be no habeas district court proceedings to review any of the determinations that occur in the ordinary removal proceeding and that 1252 would be the sole and exclusive means for aliens to obtain review of those determinations in the courts of appeals, including and subject to the limits set forth in 1252. Now, as I -- as I began to say earlier, we do think that statutory withholding of removal is -- is a very hard case for Petitioner here because everything that Petitioner says about why CAT claims are different than a final order of removal could equally be said for statutory withholding claims. And, of course, in Foti, this Court itself identified withholding of removal as the kind of decision that, when it occurs in the removal proceeding, is reviewable as part of the final order that's entered at the conclusion of those proceedings. Every court of appeals in the country was reviewing statutory withholding claims in the years post-dating Foti and predating IIRIRA. There is no evidence that Congress meant to eliminate or abrogate that practice when it adopted the definition in 1996 that -- that Petitioner has latched onto. We think also motions to reopen would not meet Petitioner's narrow understanding of what a final order of removal is."

When there is an error in the administrative process, as the government just identified below, what that means is a court has found that the administrative agency made an error in finding that torture was not more likely than not. When there -- a CAT relief -- when CAT relief is granted, that means that there is a finding that it is more than 50 percent likely that the individual is going to be tortured or extrajudicially killed upon removal to that country. The United States has made a firm commitment that our deportation system is not going to be used to send an individual to a place where they are more likely than not to be subject to torture or deportation -- or torture or death.
