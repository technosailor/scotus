You'd be asking district courts in every single Title VII case at the beginning of the case to look into not whether there was a charge filed or not, that's relatively easy, courts could probably do that, but into whether the charge captures the things that are in the complaint. And not just captures them, but consistent with the rules that the EEOC has and district courts have, that it could also be reasonably related to what's in the charge, not just that it's directly what's in the charge. So district courts would have to engage in this extremely articulated analysis at the beginning of every single case, sua sponte because they have to assure themselves of their federal jurisdiction. That's an extraordinary burden to place on the district courts and on the parties, such as in our case, where we've been litigating for five years."

You're not asking the agency for a decision. It is not deciding anything on, again, the non-federal employer side; 16 is a little bit different as I'll get to. And the analogy to the NLRA actually works against Petitioner because, as the Court noted in Zipes and Petitioner acknowledges, the NLRA was a model for much of Title VII's remedial scheme, but Congress did not copy over the critical feature of the NLRA, which is in 160(e) of Title 29, which is the provision that grants jurisdiction over enforcement actions, and a corresponding provision grants review to the court -- jurisdiction to review decisions by the board to the court of appeals."

And I think the problem that if you created an exhaustion exception now is that you would blur Arbaugh's bright-line rule and you would not only create uncertainty for lower courts about exactly how this rule applies, but you'd also make it more difficult for Congress to say in the future whether it means a requirement to be jurisdictional. And as has already been explored, this Court has applied Arbaugh to exhaustion requirements like EME Homer City and has explained in Reed that it applies across the board to elements and to prerequisites to suit -- to suit alike. Now, if I could turn second to Section 16(c), the provision that governs suits claiming discrimination by federal employers, it's very different legally and practically from what's at issue here under 5(f)."

So the only real question here is in the narrow subset of cases where a plaintiff nevertheless doesn't do so and the defendant, for whatever reason, doesn't raise that objection, must you wipe out everything else in the suit that's come to that point? And we don't see any basis in Title VII policy for that result, which wastes -- wastes courts' time, which creates unfair surprise to plaintiffs, which creates unjustified windfalls to defendants, and could impede the commission's own efforts because the logic of Petitioner's position would extend, we think, to conciliation efforts by the commission."

Arbaugh is about when you have a particular box that a plaintiff must check to get relief, is that jurisdictional at all? And for all the reasons the Court gave in Arbaugh, we think that you should assume it is not jurisdictional unless Congress says otherwise. The Title VII specific response is that for three reasons Thunder Basin wouldn't apply here. First, in Thunder Basin and Elgin, you have a statute that arguably has peeled back by implication 1331."

And if you look at the Texas Workforce Commission's web site, its annual report suggests that 25 percent of the claims that it's resolving are actually resolved to the benefit of the employee. So and -- and then this question about, well, why would a plaintiff ever not exhaust? Well, we looked and just in the last two months on Westlaw, there are at least 50 opinions in which the courts are dismissing claims because they're unexhausted. So there are many reasons you can speculate about, but it is certainly the case that right now, in our natural experiment, plaintiffs are not bringing their -- are not bringing their claims to the EEOC as Congress directed."
