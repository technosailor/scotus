And so the question for purposes of mootness is whether the enactment of SB 5890 has effectively divested the United States of that financial interest, and the Respondents have identified two possible reasons that that might be so. First, they've said SB 5890 covers all of the workers who were previously covered by HB 1723 and some more as well, and, therefore, it says, even if we were able to get the worker's claim under SB 1723 declared invalid or set aside, it wouldn't produce any financial benefit for the United States because the worker could all -- always re-file under SB 5890 and could obtain the same benefits on the same terms. We think it's not a natural construction of the new statutory language to say that the coverage would be coextensive in that way."

The same thing applies to some of the Hanford office workers, who worked in structures where there are no -- were no hazardous waste. So we think that there's at least an open question whether some of the workers who were covered by HB 1723 would be covered by SB 5890. The second mootness argument that the state has made in its letter of last Monday was that under the effective date provision of SB 5890, work -- that law will apply to all future stages in any pending controversy about a particular claimant's entitlement to benefits under the law. And so, for example, if a claimant was denied benefits by DOE and then has an appeal pending to the state industrial board, Washington's view of the law now is that if the claimant is not covered by -- even if the claim was submitted before SB 90 was enacted, if the claimant was covered by HB 1723 but not under the new law, the claimant will not be entitled to benefits because the new law will govern not only new claims but additional stages in the processing of an existing claim. And it's possible that the Washington courts will sustain that reading, but any claimant who was covered by the prior law and not by the new one can be expected to resist it. And so we think that there's at least a reasonable possibility that the -- the courts would ultimately hold any claimant in that position would be entitled to benefits if HB 1723 remains operative. And so, to summarize, it was clear before the enactment of SB 5890 that the United States would suffer harm, financial harm, from this law, and the new developments that the state have -- has pointed to don't eliminate that possibility."

And that, I think, is rarely successful, but it is commonly understood to be an available method of proof even in equal protection cases where the plaintiff has to show intentional discrimination. So I think at least part of the inquiry with respect to SB 5890 would be did the state single out this particular category of workers because it understood that the large majority of them would be federal contract workers, or did it enact the law because it was concerned with the dangers imposed by these occupations without regard to the identity of the -- the entity that would ultimately bear the financial loss."

You say that 3172 is aimed at the executive essentially, not at the legislature.

But the reason that the Court has always framed the antidiscrimination principle as no discrimination against the federal government or those with whom it deals is that it's often predictable that when there is discrimination against federal contractors, the costs of that discrimination will ultimately be borne by the United States. And the last thing, in response to Justice Breyer's question, our complaint here is not that Washington is treated -- treating the workers too generously."

The problem here is that Washington has decided that the United States should be doing more for this class of Washington residents, but it's not within the power of a single state to determine how much the federal government should be doing to solve a national problem. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
