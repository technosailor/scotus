  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2007, Tracy A. Greer pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), along with numerous other charges not directly relevant to this case. In the plea agreement, the parties agreed that Greer was \u201cpunishable as an Armed Career Criminal\u201d based on his five prior convictions for aggravated burglary under Ohio law. The district court agreed and sentenced Greer to 272 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and in 2016 it made that invalidation retroactive on collateral review. Greer moved to vacate his sentence, but the district court denied his motion, holding that his convictions qualified under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated-offenses clause, not the residual clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Rehaif v. United States</em>, which held that when a person is charged with possessing a gun while prohibited from doing so under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, the prosecution must prove both that the accused knew that they possessed a gun and that they knew they held the relevant status. The Court granted Greer\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment affirming his conviction, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Rehaif.</p>\n<p>On remand, Greer requested that the Eleventh Circuit vacate his conviction or, in the alternative, grant him a new trial, because the prosecution did not prove, nor was the jury instructed to find, that he knew he was a felon when he possessed the firearm.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit concluded that although Greer had shown plain error, he could not prove that he was prejudiced by the errors or that they affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of his trial. To reach this conclusion, the court looked at the entire trial record and Greer\u2019s previous convictions, not merely the evidence submitted to the jury. Greer again petitioned the Supreme Court for review.</p>\n",
