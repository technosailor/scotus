I think, for standing purposes, the first question a court would ask is, if this legal disability -- if this legal restriction were removed or if it didn't exist, would you make a loan to your campaign and would you wait for more than 20 days? And if the answer to that question was no, there would be no standing. That -- that's Carney versus Adams. In Carney versus Adams, the plaintiff challenged Delaware law restrictions on the party affiliations of people who wanted to run for Delaware judgeships. And, basically, the whole standing analysis was an effort to determine, would this plaintiff actually run for a judgeship if these restrictions were removed? And the Court concluded we have insufficient confidence that he would and, therefore, there was no standing. Now, if you'd asked that question of Appellees seven days before the election, the answer would clearly be no standing."

First, one of the reasons that the Court in Buckley gave for why expenditure limits were no good was that a candidate's own expenditures on his campaign will typically reduce the likelihood of corruption because the candidate will be less dependent on outside contributors for the -- the running of the campaign. And -- and a loan, to the extent that it can be repaid with post-election contributions, really has the opposite effect. It causes the candidate to be more dependent on outside contributors not just for running the campaign but for his own personal financial well-being. And the other thing I would say is the -- the Court set in Buckley a -- a limit on the amount of money that you can spend on campaign speech is de facto a limit on the amount -- amount of speech that you can engage in because, in the -- even in the 1976 modern world, let alone the -- the current world, effective electoral speech requires expenditures of money, and so a limit on expenditures limits speech. Here, the impact is much more attenuated and uncertain; that is, when they say that speech will be suppressed, what they mean is some number of candidates will be less willing to lend money to their campaigns or will be willing to lend less money and, as a result, fewer funds will be available to the campaigns to engage in speech. There may be some marginal effect of that nature, but it's much less direct and immediate than a limit on the amount of money that the candidate can actually spend."

And the three-judge district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the regulatory challenges but held them in abeyance while it adjudicated the constitutional challenge to the statute, and I think that was for two reasons. First, the district court was under the misimpression that the statute itself was the current legal barrier to full repayment. And, second, the three-judge court understandably viewed its mandate as being the resolution of challenges to the constitutionality of the statute."

And the Court has sometimes -- and the Appellees' response is the existence of this limit will create a disincentive to the making of candidate loans, and that, in turn, will result in less campaign speech. And the Court has sometimes resolved very similar claims where a candidate, as opposed to a contributor, will challenge contribution limits on the ground that they have an indirect effect on the campaign's ability to engage in speech. And the Court has said, from the candidate's perspective, so long as the limits are not so low that they prevent the candidate from amassing funds sufficient for effective advocacy, then the candidate has no valid constitutional challenge. The contributor may still have a constitutional challenge because the -- the limits may impinge unduly on his own ability to affiliate himself with campaigns to assist in the electoral process. But the -- the limit here really doesn't have that effect."

That was leveling on its face, but there's nothing similar going on here. The -- yes, it's true that the loan repayment limit applies to each candidate in the race, but the rules that apply to one candidate don't depend on what his opponent does. The other thing about the fact that the loan repayment limit applies to losing candidates, I'd say three things. The first is what Justice Sotomayor said, that it doesn't have much practical impact on losing candidates because they can rarely raise sufficient post-election contributions to be over the limit. The second thing is that, as we see in Davis, ordinarily, the presumption is that the same rules will apply to all candidates in a race, and, indeed, there can be constitutional problems if -- even if they don't. And the third is, as the Court said in Buckley, there are some circumstances where Congress decides that the same rules should apply to each candidate, even though the interests underlying a particular rule may not be as directly implicated by minor party candidates, for instance, who are unlikely to win and, therefore, are unlikely to -- to do favors for the -- the donor.
