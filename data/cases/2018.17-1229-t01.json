Retaining those phrases also made clear that where the inventive embodiment is in the public domain, the statute reaches those cases no differently from when the inventive idea is in the public domain. What Congress was trying to do in the catch-all provision -- and the House and Senate reports, the most definitive form of legislative history, bear this out -- was to achieve two objectives: to make sure that they reached all forms of prior art, such as oral presentations, PowerPoint presentations, and the like, and also to clarify that any form of prior art must be publicly available. And notably -- and this gets to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there was a change in the law -- I do think that what Congress was doing was abrogating some of the outlying lower court decisions that had extended both the on-sale bar and the public use bar to cases where there was not public availability. And, indeed, the legislative history identifies by name some of the public use cases that had so held, cases like the Beachcombers decision from the Federal Circuit and the JumpSport decision."

And I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that that's precisely why you should think that what Congress did here was fit for a purpose. I think we would certainly acknowledge that Congress could have modified the language of \"on sale,\" but what Congress wanted to do, we would respectfully submit, was also to fix some of this outlying Federal Circuit case law on public use. Now, of course, that phrase \"public use\" one might think would have inherently conveyed some notion of public availability, as Respondents themselves suggest in their brief. But, at the same time, you had the Federal Circuit extending the public use bar to circumstances in which inventions were displayed, and private parties, the JumpSport case involved a trampoline in the inventor's backyard."

I mean, in Bonito Boats, this Court, while it isn't necessary for the holding, does quote Learned Hand, and it does say it is a condition upon the inventor's right to a patent that he shall not exploit his discovery competitively after it is ready for patenting. He has to go ahead and patent it or keep it a secret forever. So an inventor who, in fact, in year one has his invention ready for patenting, and goes around from one person to another secretly selling it to each with a confidentiality agreement, is a person who is exploiting his agreement -- his invention, and, therefore, since he didn't do it through a patent, he loses the right for a patent. That seemed to me the clear -- pretty clear rationale of Learned Hand, of why the Court did that in Bonito Boats, of why Justice Story said what he said, and I think it's that that the Lemley brief was relying upon when they made that statement."

I think, if that language had been used and there had been no reference to on sale or public use, it would have been at least a permissible inference that the \"otherwise available to the public\" referred solely to circumstances in which the inventive idea had been disclosed. And that would have -- that really would have overturned a great deal of this Court's law concerning the on-sale and public use bars because those can be triggered even if the public is not aware of how the invention works, so long as physical body -- embodiments have been made available. So I think Congress got the best of both worlds by -- by clarifying that all these things have to be public in some manner, but also clarifying that making physical embodiments available is sufficient."

So, if the statute had said described in a printed publication, dot, dot, dot, or available to the public, one implication of that might be, if there weren't a clarifying word like \"otherwise\" to make clear that that new category was a residual category intended to catch things not already caught, the implication might be that, well, gosh, in order to give content to the other items in the list, we better read them to include things that are not available to the public, such as printed publications that are not indexed, that are not available to the public.

One, it would be easy to do. Two, it -- it would seriously undermine the purpose of the -- the on-sale bar because it would allow not just isolated commercialization but really rampant commercialization. And then the third -- a third point about what -- what it means to be available to the public, about whether this -- this distributor should count, and this goes back to a question that -- that Justice Sotomayor asked about, you know, if you asked a consumer, you know, what -- what would it mean to be -- to be on sale. I think if you ask a pharmaceutical company what does it mean for your product to be on sale, what that pharmaceutical company would say is we're selling it to a distributor, because, as we've cited and as we explained in our brief, 90 percent of the pharmaceuticals in this country are sold not -- not directly from the manufacturer to a consumer but to a wholesaler or a -- or a distributor."
