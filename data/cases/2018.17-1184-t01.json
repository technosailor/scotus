And I would note that it would be a rare case when you would be asked to cross-examine a statistical expert who is opining upon specific numbers that the expert has then modified through calculations without actually seeing the data sources itself. I think this Court's decision in Florida Power & Light is an important precedent in this respect because, there, the Court noted that the testimony, the well-founded testimony of an expert may be enough if firsthand information is unavailable. And, here, particularly because there were two sources the expert relied upon, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which was public, but then also her private labor market surveys, which the ALJ never saw and we never saw, that made any form of cross-examination or meaningful inquiry into the basis for these numbers impossible."

In a situation like this, where you're talking about specific numbers that the agency is relying on as the sole basis to deny my client benefits for the applicable period, there, I think, when the expert points to data sources that she has modified in order to come up with these numbers, there, substantial evidence requires more. But, in other situations, Your Honor, for example, qualitative testimony, even testimony such as these are the kind of jobs in my experience I believe somebody with these sorts of limitations can do, i.e., the first part of what vocational experts testify, I think that's entirely different. But I do think, in this situation, it would be very normal when an administrative agency comes up with specific numbers and bases a determination on specific numerical conclusions, it is the norm to then make the agency or make the expert show their work.

And that is why, particularly in a context such as this when you have multiple outdated data sources which vocational experts have to bring together, when vocational experts come up with numbers that vary enormously for the same jobs, and all the more so when this is the sole basis upon which disability benefits applicants are being denied, I think more than just the conclusory statements of the expert are what is required.

And I think the reason, again, particularly in this context of vocational experts, why this data is so important and why the failure to provide it is so practically harmful, in addition, we think, to being in conflict with the substantial evidence standard, is because these experts are bringing together very old definitions of jobs with entirely different taxonomy of job numbers, putting the numbers together and coming up with a result, and then, in certain circumstances, reducing that result further based on further hypotheticals posed by the ALJ. So it is a data-intensive process. The vocational expert identified as much in her testimony."

In sum, Your Honors, what Petitioner is asking for here is a reaffirmation of a basic rule of administrative procedure, which is that an agency cannot make a determination based upon testimony that is premised on secret data without ever giving that data to a requesting claimant. That's all the more so in a case like this, where this was the sole basis upon which my client was denied benefits for the relevant time period."
