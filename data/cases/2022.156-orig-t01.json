So, if New Jersey set up a shadow commission while this compact remained, it could give out licenses, but that wouldn't help anybody because they still couldn't work at the port without a Commission license. And so that's why, if either state tried to take the Commission to the brink by just vetoing the budget, they have the power to do that, but that shows that they have the power to get both states back to the negotiating table to find a compromise, and that's what we think these provisions show."

For bistate compacts, there was no tradition of allowing unilateral withdrawal. They either omitted a provision and seemed to have been mostly understood not to allow it, or they expressly prohibited unilateral withdrawal. And those that expressly prohibited unilateral withdrawal were boundary and water allocation compacts, so they seemed to have just been confirming the very same default rule that New Jersey agrees applies to boundary and water allocation compacts. And the Zimmermann -- the Zimmermann treatise cuts in favor of New -- New York because there is an article where Zimmermann sort of mused about the position taken by the federal government in the Dyer amicus brief, but both in 1951 and 1961, Zimmermann wrote a -- the authoritative treatise on compacts, and he said that unilateral withdrawal is not allowed unless there's an express provision for it. And I think it is much more likely that the states would have been turning to treatises about compacts than treatises about contracts."

Justice Kagan pointed out that, you know, are we looking at contract law or compact law? And I thought your answer was compact was sort of a species of contract law and that you've identified all of these compacts. But I think this might be yet another species of compact law insofar as this compact might be distinct because the parties that entered it went into it believing this is only going to be temporary.

So this is true as a matter of compacting generally that these are severable questions, and the lack of any language about dissolution tells us very nothing -- tells us very little about how to construe silence, not unlike what Justice Barrett was pointing out earlier this morning."

That's really different from what the Court was simultaneously saying in cases like Newton and Providence Bank about continuing performance obligations, and that's why the United States itself drew this exact distinction in 1951 in its brief in that Sims case, which I think is a part of the background of compacting that the states would have been quite familiar with."
