If you account for the difference in the burden of proof, though, I think the cases come to the right or come to the same conclusion that the party with the burden of proof didn't carry it. So, for example, in Taylor, all that the Court knew as the case came to this Court was that the defendant had a conviction in Missouri for Second Degree Burglary, but Missouri had seven different burglary statutes, so the case had to be remanded so that the government, the party that had the burden of proof, could produce the charging documents, and it did and the sentence was ultimately affirmed. It's the same kind of circumstance here."

But I think that's not the right approach or the right lens to -- to approach this issue for two reasons. First, as this Court has explained for a very long time, Congress intended these eligibility requirements under the predecessor statute for governing suspension of deportation and cancellation to be enforced before discretion comes into the picture. That was true in 1984 in this Court's decision in Kintakia, and it's even more true after IIRIRA and the REAL ID Act raised the bar for cancellation eligibility precisely because they were concerned that discretion was being exercised too -- too readily and the REAL ID Act had codified the burden of proof. And the second reason is that discretion -- dealing with it at the discretionary phase changes the way that this would be litigated."
