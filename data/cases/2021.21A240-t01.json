That one, I think, gives you a stronger case than the ones that don't mention health and safety at all, or, for example, for ambulatory surgical centers, you know, the provision on which you rely describes the benefits provided to an individual, and then it lists the kind of services that would be covered, right, and then, parenthetically, it says \"performed at an ambulatory surgical center (that meets health and safety and other standards specified by the Secretary),\" it seems to me a heavier lift to say that that kind of aside in a parenthetical is a grant of authority to CMS to impose this kind of vaccination requirement on those who work at the ambulatory surgical centers. So I guess my question is this: One, you know, the government here is seeking the stay of the injunction and has the burden of showing likelihood of success on the merits, and -- and I understand because of space limits and the number of statutes on which you're now relying, it would be hard to make the specific case for each of these provisions, but what if I think some of the provisions might support you and others don't? This was an omnibus rule, and even though the Secretary, in a chart, identified all these, you know, specific provisions, we don't really have before us the structural and textual arguments directed at each of these provisions."

Categorically excluding an entire class from employment will mean that patients in rural Nebraska will have to seek primary and emergency care two to three hours away and cannot undergo surgery. This represents vast stretches of this country where healthcare is not provided by massive institutional providers with tens of thousands of employees but by smaller healthcare facilities run by local communities. While a 1 percent loss of staff may be insignificant to the former, it is fatal to the latter. Without the injunction, rural America will face an imminent crisis."

If anything, I think it would be bizarre to say that the Secretary's authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients does not include the authority to adopt a measure that you see other regulators adopting, the medical community urging, and other providers adopting voluntarily. The whole point of the statute is to let the Secretary make sure that the standards of care for Medicare and Medicaid patients meet best practices, and that's what he has done here. The second point I want to make, Justice Barrett, goes back to the colloquy that you and I had earlier about some of the different statutes."

Even if you just narrow it down beyond that, three categories, the largest three categories of providers -- hospitals, home health agencies, and long-term care facilities -- account for more than 90 percent of the covered workers."

The Secretary has put out guidance after the Fifth Circuit narrowed the previously nationwide injunction to cover only the plaintiff states here, put out guidance giving regulated entities 30 days to come into compliance as to the first shot, 60 days to come into compliance as to the second shot, and making clear that even if a regulated entity has not met full compliance by that 60-day deadline, if the entity is at 90 percent compliance and has a plan to come into full compliance within 30 days, the Secretary won't take enforcement action. Even if that isn't met, even if at the end of 90 days there is still not full compliance, the Secretary has always exercised enforcement discretion before terminating a provider from the program, and one of the things the Secretary has considered is access to care issues of the sort that the other side has raised."
