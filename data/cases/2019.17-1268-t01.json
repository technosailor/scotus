But, ultimately, this Court need not decide here whether Landgraf or Altmann applies, because the first step in the analysis is to determine whether Congress has clearly defined the statute's temporal reach. And here it is abundantly clear that Congress intended punitive damages be available in two carefully defined categories of cases involving past acts of terrorism. In the subsection entitled, \"Application to Pending Cases,\" Congress set forth two categories of cases, prior actions and related actions, each of which were unmistakably directed at past acts of terrorism. Then the amendments say, in Section 1083(c)(1), \"The amendments made by this section shall apply to any claim arising under Section 1605A.\" Congress had said prior -- prior actions and related actions could file under this new 1605A, and now Congress is saying the amendments made by this section shall apply to any of those claims. And Sudan concedes, at page 43 of its brief, that that meant all of the amendments in Section 1983 apply to a claim arising under Section 1605A. That language, \"shall apply to\" -- \"to any claim,\" is virtually identical to the language in footnote 8 of Landgraf, \"shall apply to all proceedings,\" that -- that Landgraf described as an unambiguous directive and that the Court later in Martin versus Hadix described as unambiguously addressing the temporal reach of the statute."

There is just no reason to think that Congress in 2008 wanted to narrow the relief that had been available under the Flatow Amendment."

There's no reason to think that after enacting the Flatow Amendment and providing punitive damages that looked backwards, that now Congress would provide a different punitive damages remedy that looked only forward. It also, of course, would ignore the acts of terrorism that were most in Congress's mind at the time, which included, of course, this bombing here. One additional point I could make that further demonstrates that this would apply retroactively is the operation of the related actions provision."

The only reason Congress would allow somebody to bring a second cause of action arising out of the same act of terrorism would be to allow that person to provide -- to get the punitive damages that Congress, once again, was attempting to provide. So you have the text of the statute, the history of the statute, and the context in which it arose, all here together, work -- work together to persuasively demonstrate that Congress wanted punitive damages to apply to past acts of terrorism.

Circuit's primary rationale was that it would be inconsistent to allow state law punitive damages and not -- if you had already decided that the federal law doesn't, you know, doesn't provide for punitive damages, and it was that -- what it said, inconsistent outcomes at page 129 of the petition appendix that really drove the decision.
