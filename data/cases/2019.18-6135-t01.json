As such, Kansas uproots the deeply rooted by eliminating any mechanism to assess whether a defendant's capacity for moral judgment was intact or was irretrievably compromised by mental illness. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to due process first and explain why the moral capacity notion is and always has been fundamental in our system. The model penal code is an excellent example."

Petitioner suggests that this Court should recognize a theory of moral culpability and impose that uniformly across the states. But the problem with that approach is, both as a matter of history and in contemporaneous practice, there has been no agreement on the precise circumstances when mental illness should excuse criminal responsibility. And I'd like to begin, actually, with the hypotheticals that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Breyer brought up, because I think that this actually illustrates that even in contemporary jurisdictions today, there is a basic divide on when someone should be entitled to invoke the insanity defense."
