Second, a ruling that the career offender residual clause is void for vagueness is substantive and, therefore, has retroactive effect in Petitioner's case. And third, that voiding the residual clause also invalidates the Guidelines commentary that identified Petitioner's offense as a crime of violence. As such, Petitioner is entitled to a resentencing without the career offender enhancement.",

But even doing it that way, it then becomes a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an open question. So rather than get into that, I might think about your case like this: Why was the statute vague?

The judge thinks that the commission intends that this individual be treated as a career offender or somebody who has a firearms offense with a crime of violence in his background, but the judge has no way of knowing whether that is arbitrary or non-arbitrary because the commission, having borrowed vague language, ends with up with a vague statute.",
