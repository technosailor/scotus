If that 30-day deadline were imposed in this case and one could file on the 30th day and begin tolling, that would render the 14-day deliberately small window that the advisory committee drafters created in order to minimize the disruption and delay in the context of class action cases a nullity because, in any instance where you would have a longer deadline for a motion for reconsideration, you could wait out that period and avoid the window that was intentionally created by the drafters. And I would like to direct the Court's attention specifically to the advisory committee notes to the 1998 amendment to Rule 23(f), where they specifically stated the importance of the short window to deliberately keep the time as short as possible."

Undoubtedly, and as this Court has stated repeatedly in recent decisions, that there was a sort of loose use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" However, and, in fact, that loose use of the word \"jurisdictional\" was, in fact, improperly used in the Robinson case. And that has been pointed out. But the Court in more recent decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites Robinson as still good law, acknowledging, though, the term \"jurisdictional\" was misused, that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart said, observing clear limits of the rules. So going back to the second part of your question, the Robinson case specifically addressed the issue that, well, if the Court has not addressed that second portion, an act that could be allowed, if we allowed a late filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the first proscription and render, in fact, that portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity."

And in that status conference, it is notable that not only did the court not mention Rule 23(f), not mention any sort of appellate right, but counsel did not even mention 23(f), nor even say the word appeal. And, in fact, no mistake at all was made by the judge in that case. To have the rule that Lambert is urging today would have a judge effectively need to conduct a Rule 11 criminal colloquy with counsel, asking if they're aware of all sorts of potential related rights. That is asking an impossible task for a district court judge and an unfair one and goes well beyond the acknowledged sharply honed exception, which does not apply factually in this case."
