The first way is by adding that \"agent\" clause and saying employers, the aforementioned employers, that universe, are subject to respondeat superior liability. The second clause also avoids doubt by making it clear that when you are talking about employers, those persons defined in the first sentence, you are including political subdivisions and states. And I have to emphasize that you know that the \"agent\" clause is problematic because of the extremes to which Respondents go to redefine \"agent.\" They define \"agent\" to mean third-party independent subcontractor, because they cannot accept the possibility that, as is clear under the common law for hundreds of years, agents, the classic agent, are employees. So without the \"agent\" clause -- excuse me, when you define the \"agent\" clause the way Respondents do, you do end up with a disaster."

The only way that could possibly happen is if they were persons to begin with; and, therefore, if they were persons to begin with, you flow them through subdivision -- or subsection (b) and they are subject to the same employee limit. Now, if the purpose of that second sentence was to take entities that were already persons and, therefore, subject to that first sentence, encompassed by that first sentence, and make it clear that the proviso about the size no longer applies, this was a very strange way to do it.

When it amended the ADEA, in the exact same Act that it amended the FLSA, indisputably to cover political subdivisions regardless of size, it did the same thing it did in the FLSA, which is amend the definition of \"employer\" and not the definition of \"person.\" And I'd point this Court to its own decisions in cases like Gross and Nassar which say that we look to not just the language choices Congress made and assume it's intentional."

And in both those places, the restatement makes clear that some independent contractors, for example, a company hired to do layoffs, choose who's going to be laid off, administer our benefits plan and decide what the criteria are for that, those kinds of people are agents, but they're not necessarily covered by respondeat superior.

So the first question would be whether \"any agent\" means any agent whatsoever or just non-employee agents that aren't already covered. If you answered that question against, you know, what I guess would be my position as I stand here, you'd -- you'd still have a second question, which is if individual supervisors, for example, were on the hook, the question would still be, how are they on the hook?

And, third, Petitioner's contrary reading would leave a sizable loophole that would allow any employer to evade the Age Act by outsourcing discrimination to small agents. And in order to avoid that problem, Petitioner is forced ultimately to abandon the core theory they offer of the text that treats the two clauses the same way. Now, in terms of the ordinary meaning, we agree with Respondent that the language \"also means\" and its usage throughout federal statutes is clear, and it's clear that Congress used it in that ordinary way because it didn't follow the Title VII approach. Now my friend on the other side suggests that the differences in the definitions of \"person\" in Title VII versus the Age Act precluded Congress from doing the same thing. Now those differences are actually quite slight."

And just to -- to highlight those a little bit more, in the meaning of \"agent,\" not only did Congress have no reason to use \"agent\" in its broadest sense, because employees would already trigger respondeat superior liability. In this statute, Congress didn't use language that it has used in other statutes like the FLSA that lower courts and the Department of Labor have read to include individual liability. So if I can point you to one example. The FLSA, Section 203(d) at page 1-A of the appendix to our brief says that an employer includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer with respect to an employee. The FMLA, the Family Medical Leave Act, uses the same language."

And, in addition, even if you concluded that some subset of employees or supervisors were agents in some circumstances, I think you still would have to answer the question that the lower courts have consistently answered against individual liability by determining is this individual employee personally liable or is instead he liable only in his official or representative capacity. And the idea behind that is simple. If you are an employee and are counted as the employer only because you're acting as an agent, that is, only because you are exercising the authority of the employer in varying the terms and conditions of a particular employee's employment, liability naturally runs against the employer whose authority you are exercising. And to resolve that question, you would need to consider a number of principles that govern remedies law, and you'd need to take cognizance of potential spillover effects for other federal statutes, which we think is yet another reason not to delve into those issues here, because the only question you need to answer is does the \"agent\" clause add some category of additional agents. By its terms, it does."

But you can't read the two clauses as doing those fundamentally different things, one creating a novel principle of agency law and the other incorporating an employee numerosity requirement that doesn't apply to agents in the middle."
