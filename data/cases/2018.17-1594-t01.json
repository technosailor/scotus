And the other -- the point I was trying to make about the -- the two points I was trying to make about the potential for an appeal are, first, we know from the statute that Congress didn't intend to rule that out, because if the PT -- if a federal agency loses its appeal at the PTAB when it's trying to get a patent initially, the statute provides any disappointed patent applicant with a right of appeal to the Federal Circuit, and we'd have to decide whether it was appropriate to pursue such an appeal. Second, it's entirely clear from the statute that federal agencies can own patents. And those patents are potentially subject to other parties' requests for inter partes review or CBM review. So, if Return Mail felt that the Postal Service had a patent that was invalid, it could have requested inter partes review or CBM review."

And if they can get before the PTO, they will have a de novo standard of review, they'll be before the expert agency, they perceive that their chances of establishing invalidity will be greater. It's not -- and that is particularly integral to the CBM review scheme, which, as Ms. Brinkmann was pointing out, is limited by statute to people who have been sued for or charged with infringement."

What I was saying to Justice Kagan is everybody accepts that the government in litigation bears the same burden of showing patent invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. Now private parties have available to them an alternative, IPR/CBM proceedings, to try to escape that burden, to try to come before a different decisionmaker who will apply a de novo standard of review. You could think of it as roughly analogous to a primary jurisdiction mechanism, where one issue in the lawsuit is referred to an agency that has expertise in -- in the relevant area. And the Court, in applying various presumptions and clear statements rules -- clear statement rules, has been especially solicitous of the government as defendant; that is, resolving in the government's favor ambiguities about whether the government can be sued, what is the scope of its liability, et cetera. This is not quite that."

If somebody argued that the patent laws allowed any other defendant to show patent invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence but allowed -- but required a federal agency as defendant to prove it by clear and convincing evidence, I think the Court's reaction would be it's conceivable, but we would need pretty clear language that Congress intended that result. This is not quite that, but the Petitioner's argument is still we don't get access to a mechanism for a more favorable burden of proof. The second thing I would say is we've been looking at the case up to this point from the perspective of the Postal Service, and, in part, Congress created the IPR and CBM mechanisms with the interests of private parties in mind, the interests in mind of people who might be sued for infringement and would want an avenue for seeking invalidation of the patent."

Actually, under 301, there's a provision that says, when a person requests a reexamination, it can actually be confidential. So this idea that somehow there's going to be a secret person asking if the statute already says that doesn't have to be disclosed, I think that's 301(e). The second thing I would point about, just the anomaly of the agency versus agency. Whatever anyone thinks of that, it would be extraordinary for Congress to do that through silence. And to go to this question about who would represent the government, I do know that in the Civil Division, there, of course, is an office that handles the patent litigation."
