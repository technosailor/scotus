For the drugs covered by the statute, paragraph (14) directs that the agency may set rates based on acquisition cost and vary rates by hospital groups if it conducts a cost study that meets the requirements of the paragraph. If it does not do a cost study, rates must equal the average price for the drug determined by a cross-referenced statutory formula calculated and adjusted as necessary for purposes of the paragraph. Now, in the order at issue, HHS set rates for Section 340B hospitals different from the rates for all other hospitals and purported to base those rates on acquisition costs, but it did not conduct the cost study that the statute requires. Now, at the threshold, the government asserts that courts cannot review that agency action."

On the merits, the government asserts that separate cost-based rates for 340B hospitals can be justified as an exercise of the agency's authority to adjust price-based rates that the statute requires in the absence of a cost study. But paragraph (14) does not authorize HHS to vary price-based rates by hospital group, and it authorizes varying cost-based rates only in the presence of a cost study. And beyond that, HHS didn't base the rates it set for 340B hospitals on average price at all."

We think this is a situation in which the statute is clear, unambiguous, at the first stage of Chevron I -- of Chevron and, therefore, that one doesn't get to the -- to the question of whether Chevron needs to be overruled. And even if the Court finds some ambiguity in that with respect to the statute, we think this is a case very much like MCI or very much like the Iowa Utilities Board case, which is cited at page 16 of the Chamber brief, in which whatever ambiguity and, therefore, discretion the agency has, this is so far outside of it because it effectively writes this provision out of the statute entirely, and Congress can't possibly have intended to delegate the agency the authority to do that."

I have a more difficult time buying your argument that a word as broad as \"adjust\" for purposes of this paragraph would limit the agency altogether from deciding that there were regional differences that had to be compensated. So, for example, if there were higher wages in one part of the country as opposed to another, I don't see why the agency couldn't and wouldn't say for the Northeast, we think the ASOP should be 8 percent as opposed to 6 percent because wages are comparable to overhead costs and we should vary the ASOP on that basis.

And if I could just make a point about that, I think an important reason why Congress would want that kind of reliable, transparent data as a basis for varying among hospital groups is to avoid political favoritism and avoid going in -- powerful interests going in to the agency and jawboning the agency into giving them higher rates based on whatever formula they can come up with. What this statute does is say no, no, there's one way to do this and one way only; that is get the acquisition costs, make -- do a statistically significant analysis of them, and if you can justify the differences based on that transparent data that we, Congress, can look at and the public can look at, go ahead and make that."

And I think it's -- I, again, am inferring this -- but I think that's a reason to infer that Congress would have wanted to constrict the agency's ability to make these group-based variations in situations where they don't have the transparent, reliable data -- data that a cost study provides."
