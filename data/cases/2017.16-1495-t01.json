So, in response to Justice Kagan's questions about the oddity of this particular type of hearing, I think beyond the fact that the Supreme Court of Kansas has held that the purpose of this hearing is not to adjudicate guilt or punishment, I think an even more important indication of that is that, under Kansas law, nothing that happened at this hearing could conclusively resolve Officer Vogt's guilt or innocence one way or the other. And the way -- the reason that we know that is because the Supreme Court has specifically held that the dismissal of charges after a probable cause hearing is not preclusive of, and without prejudice to, the state's ability to reinitiate the exact same criminal prosecution. Which is the same rule for grand injures, right? The Court has said that just because a grand jury refuses to return an indictment does not mean that the prosecution cannot ask another grand jury to return an indictment.
