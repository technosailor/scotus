You suggest that there can really be no reliance because people, especially sophisticated parties, as Justice Gorsuch suggests, are -- are doing their own investigation of the patent's validity. Is there any reason why the reliance incurred or why there would be reliance by the parties who are the assignees that could hurt them?

Second is, with respect to the -- the choice of relying on estoppel by deed and the analogy to physical property, it allows -- your test would allow liability even when there's no misrepresentation of fact and the buyer, often in these cases large and sophisticated, more so than the seller, could easily determine the validity of the patent on its own and is better positioned to do so."

But, for many of the same reasons the doctrine should not be abrogated, it also should not be modified by this Court. Assignees have relied on the estoppel when deciding whether, at what price, and under what terms they wish to acquire patents and patent applications. Assignors have benefitted from that reliance through the enhanced assignment value the doctrine creates, and they have also been free to reject the doctrine in whole or in part when negotiating the terms of the assignment. A retrospective change would mean a windfall for assignors and radically undercutting the return on the deal for a quarter century's worth of assignees. Any modification to assignor estoppel should be made only after careful consideration of the advantages, not just the disadvantages of the doctrine."
