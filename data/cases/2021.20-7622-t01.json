The Court also has held that the tribes and the federal government are separate sovereigns for these purposes because they derive their power to prescribe conduct from different sources of authority. Indeed, there's no question in this case that if Petitioner had been convicted of his tribal offense in a tribally operated court, his double jeopardy claim would fail, no matter how much assistance that fed -- that tribally operated court received. Petitioner argues for a different result here only because the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe made the sovereign choice for its tribal code to be enforced in a Court of Indian Offenses."

So we have a long history of over 100 years of recognizing that it's not just the source of the power, the law, but the power to prosecute it, which is what your -- your plaintiff is saying. And I read Bartkus as basically acknowledging that, that the Bartkus exception was borne on the presumption that the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't want one prosecutor to decide the sequence of prosecution to give itself an advantage in the way that Justice Roberts pointed out. Here, we have one federal prosecutor deciding whether or not to give itself the potential of a pre-run of a case by choosing a lesser crime to preview the criminal prosecution and then, sequentially, that same prosecutor, a federal prosecutor, to decide to prosecute a federal crime. And so that's where I'm having my problem, which is you want a reading of the Double Jeopardy Clause that takes away a century of decisions that say it's not just the source of law, it's the source of who's prosecuting it."

That manifestly did not happen here because the prosecutor is answerable to federal authorities under the Code of Federal Regulations and the United States Code. There was some attention in my friend's presentation to whether or not these tribes have the authority to pull out from these CFR courts, and both factually and legally, they really don't. First, as a factual matter, Justice Sotomayor, as you -- as you noted -- and this is cited on page 8 of our blue brief -- is the Kewa Pueblo was required to assume jurisdiction under a CFR court, and that was in 2020, just 18 months ago."

And so, as I said in my opening presentation, far more respectful of tribal sovereignty would be simply to allow the tribes to appoint their own prosecutors to act in these courts in the interests and exercising the sovereign authority of these tribes or otherwise just to give them the resources necessary to establish their own systems. If the Court doesn't have any further questions, I'm happy to rest on our briefs."
