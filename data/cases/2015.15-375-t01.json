But if you drop out those default judgments, which, as Mr. Smith indicated, are situations where the fee motion is effectively unopposed, where I think the defendant often looks very unreasonable by not having shown up to defend the case, and where the fee amount is quite small by necessity because not much has happened in the case, then the numbers start to look more similar, 59.7 percent for plaintiffs, 53 percent for defendants. So there is not this huge gulf between the percentages of time when plaintiffs and defendants are getting fees, at least by my count.",
