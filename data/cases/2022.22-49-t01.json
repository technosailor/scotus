And Section 924(c) states that its mandatory minimum sentence shall apply to any person who engages in the basic offense conduct. As the questions this morning have indicated, Petitioner plainly falls within that category. Section 924(j) then incorporates -- then requires that the court consider whether to add additional punishment for the homicide. Whatever overall sentence the court chooses, it is therefore imposed under both Sections 924(c) and (j), and the consecutive sentencing requirement applies. Now my friend says that reading -- this reading causes conflict between the mandatory minimum sentences in Section 924(c) and Section 924(j)'s incorporation of the punishments for murder and manslaughter and, in particular, the involuntary manslaughter provision he was discussing this morning. But those provisions can be harmonized in the way I've just described."

I think that doesn't make sense, and I think, if you come to a reading where you think these are separate penalty provisions, that's actually the best evidence that these are, in fact, separate offenses for Blockburger.

It, as most, if not all, courts of appeals do, read (j) to include the mandatory minimum on (c), and it said, you know, I think the (c) five-year mandatory minimum here is sufficient given the other counts in the indictment. I think you couldn't do that on Petitioner's rule if these are separate charges and separate convictions and separate punishments because the separate (j) offense would require its own sentence, and that sentence would have to be subject to subsection (c)'s consecutive sentencing requirement in the sense that it, like all other sentences, would have to be consecutive to (c). So I think Petitioner's rule actually is -- is less lenient in a number of cases."

So I -- I've tried to explain that I think, if you hold that (j) -- you don't walk through (c) first, you don't apply (c)'s \"any person who\" language, which we think clearly applies to a person who violates (j). If you disagree with us on that, then we think you would be saying that (j)'s penalty provision -- or, excuse me, (c)'s penalty provisions are not read into (j), and at that point, I think you would explain, as Mr. Lora did in his briefs, that the reason that doesn't create an anomaly where the lesser conduct in (c) has a greater in this sense penalty of a consecutive mandatory sentence is that, in fact, the government is able to charge both (c) and (j) separately and to obtain cumulative punishments on each going forward because they are separate offenses."
