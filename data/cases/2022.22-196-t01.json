                "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over 50 years ago, in Bruton versus United States, this Court held that the admission of a nontestifying defendant's confession that accuses another defendant in a joint trial violates the Confrontation Clause, even in the face of a limiting instruction, in light of the uniquely prejudicial effect that such a confession has on the jury. This Court has made clear that the Bruton rule applies to a confession that has been redacted to avoid naming another defendant where the jury is likely to infer that the confession implicated that defendant. The question presented today is whether the manner in which the redaction is carried out is dispositive of the application of the Bruton rule. The Court should hold that it is not. In this case, the prosecution substituted phrases like \"the other person\" for Petitioner's name, but, having done that, the prosecution used the confession functionally to identify Petitioner. The prosecution's questioning of the agent who took the confession left little doubt that the confessing defendant had named \"the other person.\" Petitioner was the only defendant who plausibly could have been \"the other person.\" The prosecution described the confession as some of the most crucial testimony in the case, and having elicited detailed testimony that \"the other person\" had met up and lived with the confessing defendant, the prosecution proceeded to present evidence that Petitioner had done just that."

                "text": "In light of those considerations, it is likely, indeed, inevitable, that the jury inferred that the confession here implicated Petitioner. In applying the Bruton rule, lower courts have considered the broader context without any evident difficulty, and doing so appropriately protects a defendant's confrontation right while working minimal prejudice to the government. The government's alternative approach would draw arbitrary and formalistic distinctions and permit ready circumvention of the Bruton rule, as this case illustrates. If Bruton is to mean anything, Petitioner is entitled to a new trial without the introduction of the unconfronted confession. I welcome the Court's questions."

We have no complaint with that rule, but we simply think that when you have a situation where you have a confession that is directly accusatory of someone, then you're in the world not of Richardson but in the world of Gray. And it is the government that is asking this Court to draw an artificial distinction between a confession that says -- brackets \"the other person\" and a confession that simply says \"the other person.\""

And even the government recognizes that in cases involving, for instance, nicknames, you're going to have to look to the trial evidence to determine whether or not that nickname implicates a particular defendant. I guess what I would say in terms of the administration of this -- and I would point the Court in particular to the NAFD amicus brief, which is all about this -- is that we've now had 25 years of experience since Gray, and almost instantly, once Gray was decided, courts of appeals and state courts started wrestling with exactly the question presented here, because taking this Court's cue that further redactions could be feasible, of course, prosecutors started doing that. And I think lower courts have really had no difficulty."

And I think the more you have those references, the more details you have about what \"the other person\" did, which belies the government's weak suggestion that the jury could conclude that the defendant was somehow protecting another individual, the more the jury is going to draw the inference that a redaction has taken place here. And so I don't think the lower courts have had any difficulty applying this approach. It simply requires trial judges to do what they do every day, which is to apply common sense to determine whether the confession, in fact, even as redacted, functionally identifies the nonconfessing defendant."

And, really, in the American system, all we really have is a scattering of late 19th Century cases that don't really address the Confrontation Clause issue specifically. So I just think that this is a circumstance in which, if the Court is willing to abide by the Bruton rule -- and, again, we've had 50 years of experience and countless decisions from this Court and lower courts applying it -- the question really becomes how best to implicate the fundamental insight of Bruton, which is that confessions are a different kind of evidence where limiting instructions are insufficient."

In fact, as has been discussed this morning already, this Court already approved of a confession like this in Gray, one that was modified there to refer to other guys who also committed the crime alongside the confessing defendant. And Petitioner's surrounding context test gives rise to the same practical problems that this Court already identified in Richardson and deemed intolerable: pretrial discovery proceedings, the risk of appellate reversals under a totality-of-the-circumstances standard, and the reality that, to avoid these problems, prosecutors will often be forced to forego confessions for joint trials."

The other thing I'd say about the actual holding of Gray, of course, there's the footnote and, of course, it was about an existence, but, if all that Richardson stood for was the confessions that don't refer to the existence another person, if that is all that the Court took from it, then I think Gray could have been a very short opinion."

It apparently also depends on what the other defendants are -- the arguments they're making in the case, because he keeps emphasizing that some of the defendants were only making jurisdictional arguments.

The other is to recognize that this issue is never going to arise unless there is some risk or some reason to fear that the confession is going to be held by the jury against the nontestifying co-defendant because they just can't put that out of their minds. It's not realistic to expect them to do that. So those are -- if you -- you take either of those positions, you've got a -- you've got a clear rationale. But the Court has not done that."

And then, finally, the point of Bruton, which Justice Kavanaugh asked about, the point of Bruton is, as this Court said in Bruton, that co-defendant confessions are devastating and that by virtue of that devastating prejudice, there is, in the words of the Court, a substantial risk that a jury will consider the co-defendant's confession despite a limiting instruction. And not just a majority of the Court in Bruton but jurists from Justice Frankfurter to Judge Hand to Judge Friendly, to Judge Garth in one of the leading post-Gray opinions, to Judge Easterbrook, have all recognized that this is one of the circumstances in which juries cannot be expected to perform the task of considering evidence as substantive evidence of guilt as to one defendant but not another. I'm minded of a familiar phrase from a -- a -- a Fifth Circuit opinion, the exact provenance of which is unclear."
