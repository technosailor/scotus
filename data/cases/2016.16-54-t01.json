And, Justice, this is what Judge Wilkinson did for the Fourth Circuit in Rangel-Castenada which is cited in our briefs and we think that decision is correct. Even if what you did what the Solicitor General asked you to do, which is ignore all of that and simply pick up Black's Law Dictionary, as we've shown in our reply brief you end up in the same place, because Black's Law Dictionary, when it defines sexual abuse says that it -- we're talking about illegal sexual activity.",

And here that problem is taken care of in the State laws like -- in the states like California that have laws that reach up to 18, because as we've shown in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, all of those states have other statutory provisions that are in line with the Federal law or very close to it. So really, all you are dealing with this in this case is a few outlier -- there's actually seven outlier statutes that go further than the Federal aw, and that have backup provisions that are going to still allow the Federal government to seek automatic removal or some other immigration remedy against people that commit sexual offenses against minors.
