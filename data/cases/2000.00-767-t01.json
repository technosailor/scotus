There's no pre-existing right to remain in the United States so a new ground of removal does not interfere with any pre-existing rights. In particular, there was no right to expect to be granted relief from deportation. So, even if a new ground, substantive ground, for removal would be retroactive, and this Court's opinions would refute that, certainly taking away a discretionary power in the Attorney General to grant relief in the future is in no way retroactive. We think this case comes down to a question of deference to the Attorney General under this Court's decision in Aguirre and Aguirre and Chevron and the Attorney General has reasonably construed the act not to allow discretionary relief. With respect to jurisdiction, Congress was not required to recognize this form of relief as the sort of fundamental personal right that habeas has to be available for.",
