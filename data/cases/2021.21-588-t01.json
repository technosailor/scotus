And, here, we have it both with respect to federal court -- of course, the state has sought to supplant the traditional 1983 action, Ex parte Young action -- but we have it on the back end as well, where the state is trying to purposefully make these S.B. 8 enforcement proceedings so anomalous, procedurally anomalous, and feature rules that are so stacked in favor of plaintiffs and defendants that -- that the clear purpose and actual effect has been to chill the right. And I think that this is a response to Justice Gorsuch's questions as well because, although it is true that sometimes there's not a federal forum to raise a federal claim, for example, with defamation, it's not the case that in those circumstances the state court proceedings are heavily weighted in favor of the plaintiffs with the evident intent to chill the speech from occurring. And -- and the proof is in how this has actually worked in practice, because defamation actions haven't meant that no speech occurs."

And I recognize that this seems like a novel case, and that's because it's a novel law. But we do not think that a recognition here that the United States can -- can intervene to try to protect the supremacy of federal law would open the floodgates in the mine-run situations where a state is simply applying a private right of action through ordinary and fair state court proceedings."

At a very minimum, to the extent that this Court believes it has to somehow alter the Ex parte Young fiction or et cetera to find a way to allow the plaintiffs in Whole Woman's Health to proceed, at a minimum, the United States' case must thereby fail. The United States just conceded up here that -- that whatever interest they had would be purely retrospective as of there being some sort of ability to vindicate the -- the rights that Whole Woman's Health and other petitioners are trying to provide. They only seek a preliminary injunction, which is by definition exclusively prospective relief, and they cannot possibly maintain their action any further."

If Whole -- if the petitioners in Whole Woman's Health have some sort of avenue of relief, then the United States must not, which makes sense given for the extraordinary cause of action that they're trying to bring here. Congress has provided the United States certainly at times sometimes with truly extraordinary powers, such as the power of preclearance, you know, under the Voting Rights Act to give one extraordinary example. The United States here would want effectively a follow-on injunction for, in their words, in the event that the State of Texas changed its law or otherwise tried to, in a way of uncharitably putting it, if the State of Texas changed its law to comply with this case -- this state -- with this Court's law and yet, nonetheless, have something like S.B. 8. We have a term for when a state is put into a state where they have to get the federal government's approval before it makes a relevant legal change, and that's called preclearance. It's precisely the kind of injunction my friend on the other side was speaking of. So it can't possibly be the case they'd be entitled to that sort of remedy just as a matter of course in the event that Whole Woman's Health succeeds or prevails to any extent. That's just one component of the extraordinary expansion -- I'm sorry, I thought you were -- sorry, Justice Kavanaugh, I thought you were asking a question -- just one component of the extraordinary expansion of federal power that the United States is asking for here. Not only are they claiming a brand new sovereign interest, which can be synthesized one of two ways, either in ensuring the vindication of individual rights underneath this Court's -- underneath this Court's pronouncements in Casey in substantive due process, or, apparently, a sovereign right to ensure the expansion of access to the federal courts because, after all, Section 1983 and Congress's various statutes that compose the federal courts, they stand as they stand."

I'd like to just make three points in rebuttal, and I'd like to begin with the point that I understood General Stone to be making that if this Court ultimately concludes in Whole Woman's Health that the providers can sue, that the authority we're claiming here to sue as well is extraordinary or unprecedented. And I think it is important to recognize that when the United States of America filed this suit to try to redress the harm to the supremacy of federal law in Texas, the Whole Woman's Health providers had not been able to obtain any effective redress from the courts. The law had been permitted to take effect and it had immediately had its intended operation of chilling the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct altogether so that abortions that are protected under Roe and Casey after six weeks of pregnancy could not occur at all."

It may well be and I hope that this Court holds in Whole Woman's Health that the providers can move forward, but that hasn't stopped the harm to the sovereign interests of the United States in the meantime, as Texas has succeeded, while these novel issues worked their way through the courts, in blocking access to care that is protected under this Court's precedents. And that leads me to my second point, which is to emphasize the nature of the sovereign interest here."

The final point is to just step back for a moment and -- and think about the startling implications of Texas's argument here. Across the arguments this morning, Texas's position is that no one can sue, not the women whose rights are most directly affected, not the providers who have been chilled in being able to provide those women with care, and not the United States in this suit."
