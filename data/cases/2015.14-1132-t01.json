In particular, the words \"brought to enforce\" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require. By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit not only ignored Section 27's distinct language but also its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331. Respondents, however, begin not with the necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more aggressive position that Section 27 only creates jurisdiction over causes of action created by the Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars jurisdiction over State-based causes of action like those asserted here.",
