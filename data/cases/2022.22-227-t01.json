The First Circuit majority's reliance on the generic phrase \"other domestic government\" to sweep in tribes and apparently only tribes rests on a syllogistic interpretation of the terms \"domestic\" and \"government\" in isolation. Even if \"other domestic government\" could reasonably be construed to refer to tribes, despite their sui generis nature, the provision as a whole doesn't come close to providing the perfect confidence that this Court requires for abrogation. Indeed, Congress has long treated tribes differently than the governmental entities enumerated in Section 101(27), including under the federal bankruptcy statute preceding the code."

And so perhaps Congress -- again, none of us know because Congress doesn't refer to tribes even once in the legislative history or in the text -- but perhaps they thought: Okay, well, it doesn't -- it's not as fair to abrogate the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes, who weren't part of that deal or bargain struck in the Constitutional Convention."

But I don't want to give up the argument that tribes are domestic because I think that the question here is not whether there may have been doubt at one time, and, certainly, there was some doubt expressed before Chief Justice Marshall came down the way he did in 1831, and there may be later cases, the insular cases that -- that use the term \"foreign\" in -- in -- with respect to things that would be domestic under our test, but, rather, what -- what would Congress have meant in 1978 by using the word \"domestic\"? And I think that by 1978, after the many times that this Court had used the phrase \"domestic dependent nations\" and the -- the -- the -- the -- that a -- a reasonable person reading the statute at that time would say: Yes, tribes are clearly domestic."
