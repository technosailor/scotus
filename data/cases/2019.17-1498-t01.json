And the question, I guess, is why do you -- why do we think the statute requires those consequences as to a person whom has -- who has never been treated as a PRP by the government, who has never been involved in settlement negotiations, who, under reigning law, including the statute of limitations, has no liability exposure? I mean, it would seem a big deal to take a person like that and say you've lost some significant property rights."

And the water barriers that we've discussed in this case are a good example, where EPA has a considered plan to treat the water in a certain way, and Respondents want to dig -- I think it's an 8,000-foot trench that would change the gradient and would physically change the land in a way that could endanger the whole Superfund site off of their own property.

In the regulatory materials, there is absolutely no finding that that wall, much less the one that we've proposed which is different, would call any environmental harm."
