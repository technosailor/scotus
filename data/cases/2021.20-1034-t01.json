Under the Second Circuit's rule, which is articulated at Petition Appendix 14a and 81a, the district court had to order return \"if at all possible.\" That \"if at all possible\" standard, in our view, places too heavy a thumb on the scales in favor of return. It essentially renders denial of return a highly disfavored remedy, despite the convention's objective of protecting the child from grave harm. And so, if this Court were to reject the Second Circuit's rule and remove that thumb from the scales, the district court may well evaluate the sufficiency of the ameliorative -- of ameliorative measures differently on -- on remand."

What it should not have done is mandate that the district court engage in another round, another full examination of whatever ameliorative measures exist, including measures that Respondent had never even proposed. That added nine more months to the proceedings that had already lasted 10 months. And while it's true that we cannot undo the procedural implications of the Second Circuit's rule, that is, we can't go back in time and put us back to where we were a couple years ago, what the Court can do in our view is undo the substantive implications, which is to vacate the judgment below and at least send it back for the district court to take a fresh look at this in light of the right standard."

I think, once this Court -- if this Court were to remove the thumb on the scales, it's possible the district court would feel, frankly, less pressure to conclude that return was appropriate in light of these measures and may well think that, although there are some indications going both ways on whether Respondent would or would not comply, it's simply not worth the gamble to send the child back.

To refuse to consider measures that might allow for the safe return of children back to their home country would be an abuse of discretion and would violate the purpose of the convention, which is built on a system of mutual trust between signatory nations. This approach supported by the Hague Conference ensures consistent results here in the United States and expectations for U.S. children abducted abroad by providing courts clear guidance on how to evaluate this exception. The lower court here took into consideration the unique facts of this case and of this family. Specifically, the limiting provisional order in this case addressed the grave risk of harm to this child which was caused by potential exposure to domestic violence between the parties. The return order helps to -- to deter future abductions, which Congress has found to be harmful to children, while also protecting the interests of this child, ensuring that the custody dispute takes place in Italy, his home country. The core premise of the convention is that the interests of children in matters relating to their custody are best served when custody decisions are made in the country of habitual residence. Ultimately, the treaty is not about who should have custody but, rather, where those decisions should be made. The Italian courts have already issued orders protecting this child, and they have scheduled -- scheduled a hearing in June to address issues of custody. As this Court found in Abbott, there is no reason to doubt the ability of other contracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best interest of children. Further, as this Court found in Monasky, domestic violence should be an issue fully adjud -- fully explored in the custody adjudication upon the child's return. The Court should, therefore, affirm the order directing the immediate return of B.A.S. back to Italy. I'm happy to entertain any questions."

Again, if they -- if it's an extreme case where an abductor has violated and shown a propensity to violate court orders in the past, where the abducting parent has sought orders of protection and sought the refuge of police in the home country and they have not offered their assistance back home, in those types of cases, the court can easily consider and say: I've thought about how we can protect this child, none of them I think will work, and they can move on to their final decision. We do not believe that the mandatory consideration adds any more time because, if they believe that it could assist in returning the child and implemented that, then it would take the same time whether it was discretionary or mandatory, and it would take the same time if they denied the implementation of the ameliorative measures.

So there really was no delay in obtaining the necessary ameliorative measures to protect this child in this case, and oftentimes there will not have to be. If this Court does not have any further questions, we certainly would urge this Court to affirm the return of B.A.S.

And so, if we go back the three years to March 22nd of 2019, when the district court made that grave risk finding, I just want to note that that finding was never even appealed. It stands to this day, all of those findings of horrific violence, of the character failings of Mr. Saada, and of the harm, psychological and physical harm, to the young child in this case. But everything that followed from that is infected by the Second Circuit's mandatory requirement to exhaustively consider and try to find a way to send the child back.
