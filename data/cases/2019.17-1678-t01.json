Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here."

Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach."

Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases. As opposed to, I think, where the inquiry historically has focused, immunity."

But even if this Court, nevertheless, believes that it's appropriate to map on that presumption, I actually think Kiobel helps us more than it hurts us, because, in Kiobel, this Court said there will still be cases in which the -- the underlying conduct, the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint, involves activity that touches and concerns U.S. soil with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. And so I think this Court could assume without deciding that extraterritoriality is a special factor for purposes of Bivens and still say this case is different because Respondent was standing on U.S. soil at the time he pulled the trigger, that is touching and concerning U.S. territory from my perspective the way Kiobel meant it."

Right? That's what we're worried about because it's not clear how that wouldn't potentially, if not in this case, swallow the category, right? That is to say, if Abbasi meant what it said when it said there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens in the law enforcement context, we think that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, even when the government has other -- other equities at stake. Because, again, the key for us is when a court is saying an individual officer has acted ultra vires, it is not the same thing as saying the government's policy is somehow inconsistent with the Constitution. It's not the same thing as saying we are second-guessing how the government has chosen to conduct border patrol policies."

Taking a step back, Abbasi and other decisions have made lower courts markedly less willing to imply causes of action for damages. If this Court extends Bivens here, on these facts, it will threaten to reverse that trend by undermining this Court's consistent message about the importance of caution and judicial modesty in this area. To turn to the first of the three special factors, the foreign relations with Mexico, I don't think it's difficult to figure out exactly why we think Congress might pause, as it has in 1983 and the FTCA, before extending damages liability here. The United States and Mexico have an active disagreement over what happened here."

Distilled to its simplest, the government's position in this case is that officers in what is self-described as the nation's largest law enforcement agency should have a functional absolute immunity at least where foreign nationals are concerned.
