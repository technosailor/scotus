But, as to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor, this is a case and a legislative record different from what the Court had before it in Florida Prepaid. It is much stronger in relevant part. In part, that's because of the fundamental difference between copyright law at issue in this case and patent law that the Court was looking at in Florida Prepaid. In part, it's also because you have a legislative record that is so much stronger, Your Honors."

And I would also note, as to the 16 examples that we're talking about, those examples are really in the nature of reports, Justice Alito. So one of those reports was from the Motion Picture Association of America, which said that films were being shown by state prison authorities widely.
