I think you're right that if you took the word \"tribunal\" alone in ordinary speech, that would pose a somewhat different question. But, if you look at the way Congress has used the word \"tribunal\" historically, at the time that this statute was passed in 1964, Congress had used \"tribunal\" many times in statutes. Every single time, it had used the word \"tribunal\" to refer to a government entity. And in situations after 1964, I think there are a couple of -- of examples where Congress used the phrase \"arbitral tribunal,\" I think what's notable is that it added the -- the adjective \"arbitral\" because it wanted to signal that it was going beyond its standard sort of government-focused usage of \"tribunal\" to -- to capture arbitral tribunal."

And I would assume it would be an abuse of discretion to go much further without a compelling reason.
