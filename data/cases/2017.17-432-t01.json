The way we have proposed the solution to this case is if the claim is timely and it's timely as an individual matter, the individual can bring in, under Rule 23, that is a very straightforward, clean, simple rule. So, if you were to then look at, say, we don't accept the simple rule, we want to have something a little bit more complex, I think at the very least you would say: Was the plaintiff who brought that adequate to represent the class and was there a deficiency in the adequacy of that representation?
