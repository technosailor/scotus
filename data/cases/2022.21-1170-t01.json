To begin with the right-to-control theory, which is the question presented, the Second Circuit crafted that theory based on non-traditional ideas drawn from a set of cases that did not examine fundamental questions of what property means under the property fraud statutes. Those statutes incorporate the common law, as this Court has repeatedly held, and --"

Is it enough to say you -- the fact that there was interference with a right of control, that's not property, but the fact that you're trying to get contract money, that is property? And then, as to all the other elements of the prosecution, whether it's what's the right materiality standard, whether it's -- whether it's do you have to show economic loss to the defrauded party, as to all those elements, I mean, they're just not in this case at all. Didn't we basically take this case to decide was there a scheme to obtain property here?

The government originally had an indictment in which it did charge that the ultimate state-awarded contracts were the property interest, the same thing that my friend now says is the property interest. But there was a case in the Southern District of New York called United States versus Davis in which the government had gone to trial on a similar indictment that charged a contract as the property interest, and then it tried to save the conviction by pointing to the right-to-control theory, which is very vast and nebulous. And the district court said you cannot do that."

And so, once that is out of the case, I think you have to ask the question whether the evidence that was introduced to prove the crime charged satisfied the elements of that crime. And the government can't come up on appeal as it has done here for the first time in this Court and said: Since this is a sufficiency case, we get to completely reinvent the theory, we get to substitute in a new one for the defective one that the Second Circuit used, and the only question that we ask is whether the evidence was sufficient under that theory, and we can ask the Court to announce this new theory for the first time in this case.

It's always been property fraud to have fraudulent inducement like in this case, where the victim is tricked into paying for something fundamentally different from what he bargained for. Both in their reply brief at Footnote 2 and just now, Petitioner acknowledges that receiving specific property different from what the victim expected, like a horse with a different name, even if it has equal value, can be fraud. To the extent there's daylight between the parties about the substance of what property fraud covers, I think it goes to cases of what I might call pedigree fraud, where there's a lie about the certification of property or important to us would be a case where, for example, someone lies about their eligibility for a veterans preference in contracting. And we would say that that's fraud, and it's always been fraud at common law."

In particular, what we think the Second Circuit has done that's really its sort of fundamental conceptual mistake is, instead of housing the -- its idea that there needs to be some way in which the victim is not getting what it's bargained for in materiality, where we think it properly belongs and where the Court put it in, for example, Universal Health Services, interpreting the standard definition of materiality in the particular context of contracting, it has added this tangible harm requirement that goes into the property element. Now I think, if you asked Congress when it implemented the mail fraud statute is use of property property, they would have said, yeah, you know, Blackstone says that it is for -- for those learned in Blackstone. And -- but I think, if you ask them is use of property that result -- that is influenced by information about an economic decision that leads to tangible harm property, you're starting to gerrymander the definition of property beyond something that Congress would have understood."

And if you want to look at examples of how the kind of thing I described as pedigree fraud was covered at common law, I'd encourage the Court to look at some of the turn-of-the-century cases at pages 753 to 754 of the Prosser treatise, which is cited in our brief. One of those cases, Hedden against Griffin, is a case by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts at the time when I believe Justice Holmes was on that Court, although he didn't write the opinion, and in that case, the victim was tricked by the defendant into thinking that a bunch of his friends had bought a particular type of insurance and, in fact, they liked it so much, they didn't quite buy the company, but they became members of the Board of Directors of the company. He himself bought the insurance, realized he'd been tricked, and the Court acknowledged it was a perfectly valid insurance policy."
