But, if what that phrase at the end of Section 3 means is a statutory default, in other words, that the party was in default in proceeding with their rights under the FAA by requesting a stay too late in the case, then that is something that the Court could analyze under federal common law because you're putting content to what that procedural provision of Section 3 --"

I -- I can't speak for why the AAA put that language in their contract, but it's been in their standard rules for many years. And many federal courts, including federal courts that subscribe to the erroneous view of the FAA that requires prejudice, have looked at that language and said we're going to find a waiver notwithstanding this language. So whatever the AAA's reason for including it, it hasn't stopped courts from finding waiver if the parties' conduct rose to the level of an intentional relinquishment of their right to arbitrate. The mistake that those courts have made, even though they -- they didn't rely on that -- that AAA rule language, was that they analyzed the question under federal law exclusively instead of first looking at whether there had been a waiver under generally applicable contract principles of state law. Basically, they continued this mistake that the Eighth Circuit made here of applying an arbitration-specific waiver defense instead of a generally applicable one, and that's why this Court should remand for the Eighth Circuit to apply the correct generally applicable contract test in the first instance."

Often the two can be present in the same case, but what distinguishes them, and when, as here, you know, Ms. Morgan argued waiver and she did not argue estoppel, what should distinguish the doctrine is she would need to prove that -- that Sundance did something intentional, that it -- that it did actions, committed actions that would lead to an inference that it did not intend to rely on its arbitration right.

Now, if she hadn't argued waiver, if that wasn't present in the case, now that -- because it is, it has to be argued under state law -- if she hadn't, but because Sundance sought a stay under Section 3, then the Court has an independent obligation under Section 3 to assess whether the applicant for that stay was in default in proceeding with the arbitration. So that's where you get to the Section 3 question. To Justice Kagan's question, that could be state law too if it's only about rights under the contract, but if it's about rights under the statute, if it's about what does the FAA require to -- for someone to be in default in proceeding, then that would be a federal question."

And so, if you look at Footnote 9 of Perry v. Thomas, that says \"state law, whether of legislative or judicial origin\" -- so that's why your first and third would be treated the same -- \"is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\" Going -- continuing to quote, \"A state law principle that derives its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with this requirement of Section 2.\" So I think the first and third rules you described would be arbitration-specific. The second, because some other contracts are treated the way arbitration is treated, would be a closer question, and I think, you know, the state law should -- state court should have the opportunity to look at that in the first instance, but it might not be arbitration-specific because other contracts are treated similarly."

But I also take Justice Alito's point that's been echoed here that all the courts of appeals have seemed to treat it as -- as not a question of state law but of federal law. And, for my money, I -- I can see why, because Section 6 says that motions to arbitrate are to be treated like any other motion in federal court and are subject to the rules of federal -- federal jurisdiction, federal courts. And, as I read the cases, I see the courts of appeals trying to apply usual principles of -- of waiver or forfeiture that this Court has announced for use in federal proceedings. So, while you might have a state law defense, don't you also have a federal law argument that -- and -- and couldn't we simply say that part of federal law, to the extent it includes waiver, doesn't generally require prejudice? Under this Court's teachings, it's usually just an intentional relinquishment of a known right. And I guess I'm curious why you didn't pursue that argument, or maybe you have and I've misunderstood today's proceedings, which have seemed to have focused on Section 3. Can you help me out?"

Circuit is correct to step over the Section 2 part of the analysis of looking at this as a contract question.

Now they would have intentionally been doing that because they would have been saying this isn't the right court for this litigation. And, oh, by the way, Justice Kavanaugh, all of the things in the federal rules that say you have to put this in the first responsive pleading are really going to the idea that this is just not the right federal court for this to be in.

But to take something that doesn't go to that court's jurisdiction and put it in there, I would describe that loosely as disfavoring arbitration, and I don't think that's what you're supposed to do in interpreting the -- the -- the FAA. And I do think, in getting the incentives right here, you can't ignore the incentives of the party that first defaults, that first violates the arbitration agreement. I mean, if you -- if you err entirely on saying, boy, that defendant, they have to raise that thing in their very first pleading, that is going to make more parties who are plaintiffs say: Well, you know, the defendants are kind of in a box because I've been thinking about this litigation for six months."

We're past the point where we get to amend as of right, but this is one of the many things in the federal rules where you have, like, an ability to make a motion, but there's no strict deadline. And so the way the courts would figure out whether it's too late to amend your complaint to add arbitration would be to essentially say, well, the presumption is leave is freely granted, but we withhold it in certain circumstances and we look to prejudice. In fact, cases like Forman, which we cite in our brief, say that prejudice is more or less the -- the most important factor. Similarly, in sort of Kontrick against Ryan, it's another case where this Court was dealing with forfeiture issues and kind of talked about the same principle. Prejudice is an important part of that inquiry."
