The government, however, refused for many years to comply with that change, and, to avoid the consequences of that refusal, it now asks this Court to read that change out of the statute entirely and deprive Congress's explicit rejection of the two-step notice process of any meaning. This Court, however, should give meaning to IIRIRA's changes and should hold that a notice to appear, like an order to show cause, is a specific notice document that includes all of the information specified in the statute.

In conclusion, Congress could not have been clearer in IIRIRA that the statute used to authorize a two-step notice process: an order to show cause followed by hearing information in the order to show cause or otherwise. And in IIRIRA, Congress cut the language authorizing the separate hearing notice and required the time and place information be included in the notice to appear itself. That change only makes sense if both the order to show cause and the notice to appear are specific notice documents."

But, when the border patrol arrests the alien and it's the one that issues the NTA because it's the investigating agency and it has -- has knowledge of the charges, the government's detention decision is normally then made by ICE because the border patrol doesn't detain the individual, ICE has to, and it has to make the determination based on its resources.
