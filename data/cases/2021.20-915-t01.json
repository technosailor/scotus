Second, Section 411(b) is pretty unique among the statutes that this Court has encountered in the past in that it's not requiring knowledge of several elements and all you have to do is figure out which one needs to be knowing, but, here, it requires knowledge of very -- something very specific. It inquires knowledge that the information reflected in the application is wrong, not knowledge of what happens to be right or wrong in the world outside the application, not knowledge of things that might help you figure out that the application is wrong, not the ability with reasonable diligence to figure out whether the application is wrong, but knowledge that there is wrong information on the application. If you don't have that knowledge, the belief of a wrong thing on the application, you don't have what Section 411(b) requires, period. Nothing in this statute suggests that it matters one bit why you don't have that knowledge."

That just does not make sense, and it has never been the law throughout many decades under what was often called somewhat colloquially the fraud-on-the-Copyright-Office doctrine, you know, there are variations on how courts applied this doctrine, but the sort of through line are the two that ended up in 411(b), a knowing misstatement and materiality, that it actually could have affected the registration process. So never before could a court invalidate your registration and not even let you get in the courthouse door because they thought you should have known the law that it has now announced when you were filling out and checking boxes about publication -- published or unpublished, derivative work, not derivative work, works for hire, not works for hire.
