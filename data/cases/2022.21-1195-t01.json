So the -- the thing that I'm trying to get my mind around is the fact that in 5314 I don't even see the word \"account.\" It -- it says -- you know, it refers to persons who make a transaction or maintain a relation. So, first of all, we have no account word in this statute, and then, when I look at the history of it, it appears to me, and you might correct me if I'm wrong, that Section 5314 originally directed the Secretary to require any resident or citizen who engages in any transaction or maintains any relationship to file this record. And, when they amended the statute, they said -- they changed it to the language that exists here but said this is really not a material change. So, if that's kind of how we're looking at it, then I think maybe we're not even being directed by the statute to care so much about the accounts because what Congress was trying to do is give the Secretary information about who was engaged in these kinds of activities, and then the Secretary could go afterwards and ask them for more information. There's that provision about the 25 accounts or whatever, you don't even have to give the information."
