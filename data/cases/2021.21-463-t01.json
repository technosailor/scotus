Texas incentivized enforcement through awards of at least $10,000 per prohibited abortion against each defendant, without any showing of injury, and it added draconian one-sided fees provisions, with liability extended even to attorneys themselves. The combined effect is to transform the state courts from a forum for the protection of rights into a mechanism for nullifying them. As Respondent Dickson has said, no rational abortion provider would violate this law. While court clerks are not ordinarily proper defendants, in these circumstances, the principles underlying Ex parte Young authorize federal court relief against clerks."

Well, this Court, in Grupo Mexicano, said, specifically speaking about an expansion from a post -- a post-judgment creditor's ability to distraint a debtor's assets, moving to a pre-judgment creditor's ability to do so, that was simply too great of a novel equitable innovation for this Court to be able to permit itself to essentially innovate. To do something that would have been understood in Ex parte Young, in the very same opinion, as the violation of our whole scheme of government, is surely a much greater innovation.

There is a separate provision of the very -- of that law that specifically says that nothing in the section is -- basically prohibits individuals from asserting their constitutional rights. And so, to the extent that the Texas legislature has either imperfectly or in an incomplete way recorded as a matter of state law this Court's -- this Court's recognition of the Casey right, individuals may still erect that right fully and completely.

In 1789, we had just created a new system of government, so we never had an Ex parte Young or any other injunctive relief between governments because we didn't have anything like this before in England or anywhere else, the system of government we have created. Now I take and I listen to what Ex parte Young said about not interfering with the work of the coordinate branches, ongoing work of the coordinate branches, but one thing that we said in Cooper versus Aaron was equally important, and that is \"constitutional rights declared by this Court can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislatures or state executive or judicial officers -- and these are the key words -- \"nor indirectly through evasive schemes.\" So, given what I just said, that that principle is inherent in the Constitution, why am I limited by Grupo Mexicano? Why would I be looking to a history that can't exist by its very nature? What does exist are the words we said in Ex parte Young, which was we are charged by Congress in ensuring that federal rights are respected directly or indirectly. So could you respond and tell me why we're limited by anything in terms of what an equitable remedy would be like, assuming we were to find -- and you can challenge the assumption, but you'll waste your time -- assuming we were to find that this was intend -- this scheme was intended to chill abortions that were constitutional?"

The Court recognized a limitation in Grupo Mexicano that I don't understand -- it was across a public/private distinction but was a separation of powers distinction between whether or not this Court or Congress had to expand beyond traditional equitable remedies available. And if nothing else from Ex parte Young is significant on this point, the one thing that the \"violates our scheme of government\" point is relevant for is that plainly is an indication that that kind of injunction is not traditional equity."
