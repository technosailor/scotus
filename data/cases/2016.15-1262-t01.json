Even though the two congressional districts here -- and they're both North Carolina congressional districts -- the issues presented by the two districts are actually quite distinct. With respect to Congressional District 12, it is different from both the House of Delegates districts in the previous case and Congressional District 1, because this was not a district that was drawn with an avowed intent to create a majority-minority district to comply with the Voting Rights Act; rather, with respect to Congressional District 12, this was avowedly a political draw. Now, if that all sounds familiar, it's because it's the exact same dynamic that was before this Court in Cromartie II.",

I think Cromartie II was about as clear as it could have been, that in a case where you have a majority-minority district or something approximating it, and you have race and politics highly correlated, and you have somebody challenging the State's suggestion that this is a political and not a racial draw, what the plaintiffs must show -- not can show, not may show, not it would be nice that they show -- must show, is that there are alternative ways that the legislature could have accomplished its political goals without a comparable emphasis on race --",

So I think in a world like that, especially when you've already said it, to say that there is an alternative map requirement as a gatekeeping function, to guide a district court, to give the district court the same tools you used in Cromartie II, to say, ah, you know, it's easy to say that there was a pretext, but when I actually look at this -- you know, and I'm going to -- I'm going to -- at the end of the day, I mean, I'm going to look at the alternative map in conjunction with the direct evidence, the circumstantial evidence, but I'm at least going to be guided by something that says, you know, there was another way to do this, and that really does make me think that this direct evidence is a lot more probative than it might otherwise, because I see there was an easy alternative.",
