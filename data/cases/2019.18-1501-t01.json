The second example that I would give you is the Fifth Circuit's decision in SEC versus Blatt, and that was a decision in which it explicitly stated the money was going back to the investors. And so, to the extent that what the government has sought to assert here is the authority to send the money to the Treasury, well, would Congress have looked to the decision in Blatt and said: Well, no, actually, the money, it looks like it would go back to the investors and not to the Treasury."

And so, when Congress passed Section 21(d)(5) in 2002, if you were asking kind of a conscientious well-informed member of Congress what do you think you are authorizing when you authorize district courts to issue appropriate -- equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary, the first thing they would ask is, what kind of equitable relief have courts been awarding up to this point? For -- for instance, when you get statutes where -- that authorize a court to issue an injunction in accordance with the principles of equity, how do you decide whether a particular injunction is in accordance with the principles of equity? You look at the way that equity courts have been doing it in the past. And the lesson the Court has drawn is you look to factors like adequacy of the remedy at law, irreparable injury, a grant of authority to proceed in accordance with the principles of equity, is basically an admonition, keep doing it the way that courts of equity have been doing it. And, similarly, in 2002, a conscientious member of Congress would have thought, at the very least, I'm authorizing courts to continue to enter the equitable remedies that they have entered up to that point."

The other was Mr. Rapawy is correct that some of the money was spent on things like equipment, facilities, things that in another context might have qualified as legitimate business expenses had there been a true intent to construct a cancer treatment facility and do what the marketer said they were going to do. What the district court said -- and I believe this is on page 18a of the Petition Appendix -- it characterized those expenses as a half-hearted attempt to convey the illusion of progress. And so the court's analysis on that point was not extensive, but -- but we take the point to have been these were not legitimate business expenses because they didn't represent a true good-faith effort to construct the relevant facility."

We would agree that, had the investors had it in their minds to construct the facility and it just didn't pan out at the end of the day, those would have been the sorts of things that could have been used as deductions. But given the conclusion of the lower courts that this was a pervasively fraudulent scheme in which essentially all of the expenses were made to perpetrate the fraud, then we think it's in accordance with traditional equitable principles to allow no deductions. But, again, the point we had stressed most strongly is we think that Congress has authorized courts to award disgorgement as computed under traditional rules of equity. If in a particular case or even if in some larger category of cases the Court believes that exorbitant disgorgement has been awarded, then the proper response is be more careful about -- to tell lower courts be more careful about the computation. It -- it couldn't under any circumstances be a justification for holding that Congress has not authorized disgorgement at all. If there -- there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to affirm."
