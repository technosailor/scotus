And, also, as I suggested to Justice Gorsuch and I think fleshed out a little bit more with Justice Kavanaugh, I think the cross-designation statutes at least contemplate that there will be some kind of affirmative conferral of authority if tribal officers are to conduct arrests that effectively stand in the shoes of federal officer arrests.
