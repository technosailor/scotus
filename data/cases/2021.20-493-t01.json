If you remember in Cabazon, it talked about the fact that Congress made the decision to help -- have the tribes do this in terms of their self-sufficiency. So I think the sovereignty aspect of it shouldn't be and can't be overlooked because that's where 107(b) comes in."

Section 107(a) forbids a tribe from engaging in gaming activities that are prohibited under Texas law, and Section 107(b) further provides that Section 107(a) does not grant the state civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction.

Then, if you look at 107(b), it uses that same phrase \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" but inserts \"regulatory.\" And that was the exact distinction that Cabazon drew.

So -- so it says, you know, we don't want to give the state regulatory jurisdiction, meaning the state doesn't have any regulatory power here. Then the third thing would be what Justice Barrett said, I think you've responded to that, the other statutes passed around the same time, actually, on the same day, right, that clearly understand the Cabazon prohibitory/regulatory distinction. So you take all of those together, and this is what I meant when I said to Mr. Yang Cabazon is, like, written all over this statute.

And I believe Justice Alito asked a few minutes ago how you determine whether you are going to apply a canon about assuming Congress -- or it might have been Justice Kagan -- I apologize -- about when you assume Congress was understanding the particular context. Normally, this Court does that when you have a well-established term that's been used a number of times, whereas, here, you have just the term \"prohibit,\" which is a commonly used statutory term, it's been interpreted once in a case that respectfully is not the most precise case this course -- Court has ever issued."

That's not the phrase that we have in -- in the Restoration Act."
