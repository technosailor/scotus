That's the same way federal law requires the United States to notify Congress to enable intervention when it stops defending a statute. But where an authorized state representative is actively defending the law, Rule 24's goals of ensuring coherent presentation and simplified litigation should prevail. And this case is the poster child for why federal law puts a thumb on the scale against intervention when a state agent is already there defending. Unlike in Cameron, there's just no need for intervention here."

For all -- so for all of those reasons, if the Court is concerned about legislators' ability to protect their legislative interest, this distinct narrow legislative interest, the proper course would be to grant them permissive intervention, not mandatory intervention as of right.
