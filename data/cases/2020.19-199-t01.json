So it's sort of a combination of the sense of what is a final decision, but also the other step of is it the kind of final decision that courts can review in a meaningful sense? And that, I think, is the distinction, again, that Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers mostly drew."

I want to pick up on something Justice Breyer brought up about the history of this issue and case law, because my understanding's very different from his, and I just wanted to get that out there, and you can respond. So here's my understanding of what's happened on this issue over the years: In 1966, Judge Friendly issued an opinion for the Second Circuit that said there was judicial review of these kinds of reopenings, and that's been the law in the Second Circuit for 54 years now. It's in a \"but see\" in the government's brief, but that's been the law in -- in the Second Circuit. Then along comes Califano in 1977, dealing, of course, with a different act with different language, and says no judicial review there. And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the -- to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call -- Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g."

You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said."

So, in thinking about the 231g question and whether the denial of a motion to reopen determines rights or liabilities, I think, when you look at 261.2 and the regulations, if you're thinking about 261.2(b), you know, if a denial is essentially a conclusion that there was no new or material evidence of error, then I can see how that might qualify as a determination of a right or a liability. But what about in Mr. Salinas's case? I mean, is it fair to -- to characterize his motion here as a motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen (b)(4)?"

And the other piece of it is the Board obviously has the discretion to say that, yes, you know, even though four years have passed, you presented new evidence and we're willing to consider that here. And the question is always going to be, was the Board acting reasonably in excusing that or not?

And so I take the government's position to be, well, perhaps if all final decisions under the RUIA are reviewable, then employers could get reopening with respect to whether or not they are covered by the RUIA. For instance, if they could show that an initial coverage determination was wrong for some reason or they had new evidence about -- that wasn't considered, or changed circumstances. But yet they somehow couldn't do that under the RRA, even though that's the scheme that tends to take the most -- tends to -- tends to bear the heaviest burden on employers. Again, that would be hugely perverse. And if you thought that reopening isn't a right or liability under the RRA because it's not a change from the status quo, you'd also have real concerns about other determinations that suddenly wouldn't seem to be reviewable either under that scheme, for instance, denials of modifications of benefits or terminations of benefits, where, for instance, let's say the employer found fraud and wanted to reopen a long-term annuity decision and alert the Board to it."
