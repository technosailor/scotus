If you look at the appendix, the fourth amended complaint, page 85 of the appendix and page 90 of the appendix, among the allegations in the complaint is not only do we think lethal gas would be a viable alternative method, but we also say, if after adequate discovery it turns out it might be possible, we just don't know, but it might be possible to alter a lethal injection protocol in a way that would satisfy constitutional standards. So, if you vacate the judgment, if you remand it to the district court, in part because circumstances have changed, we don't know whether the changed circumstances will prevail at the time an execution is scheduled, but in part because circumstances have changed, if you vacate and remand, then we can go back, we cannot only look into the question of what's -- how the comparison in light of any new circumstances would be to the lethal -- unknown aspects of lethal gas, but we can also figure out whether there are other ways to modify a lethal injection protocol that alleviate this grave concern."

But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross."
