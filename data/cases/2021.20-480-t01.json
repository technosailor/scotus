So I don't think the fact that they are civilian answers the fundamental question, which is, is Babcock serving as a member of a uniformed service at the time? Now my friend on the other side says, well, that's a different hat because that is the hat National Guard, the state National Guard. But, as I say, if that's the test, then it would mean inactive duty folks who stand very much like Mr. Babcock don't get the -- they wouldn't be able to be eligible for the uniformed service exception either because they are the same -- they fall in the same exact category."

First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times. And, third, in Title 5, Congress defined technician employment as falling within the civilian service of the government and ensured that technicians would receive civilian retirement payments for their civilian employment. I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point."

And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service. Now dual-status technician service is different because Congress has categorized that service as outside the uniformed service and the payments for that service as civilian in nature."

And -- and so, fine, he served as a civilian when he was working as a technician. That was -- that's how you classified it. But just looking at the language of the statute -- and I think this is the argument in its simplest terms as I understand it -- was -- were the payments based -- were they made wholly on service in the capacity of -- as -- as a member of the uniformed service, and the answer he would give is yes because, while you denominate it civilian for certain purposes, you also said it could only be performed by someone who is a member of a uniformed service.

And I think even if the Court were to accept my friend on the other side's functional approach, which says that this looks like National Guard service, so we should treat these payments as it for being payments that trigger the uniformed services exception, that doesn't work because \"wholly\" indicates that even if you're taking that functional approach, which we don't think you should, the payments are not wholly based on that.

But that's actually completely against the text of the uniformed services exception. And if this Court were to find that dual-status technician payments trigger the uniformed services exception, it would be the only situation in which a CSRS payment could be entirely based on military service and would be subject to the uniformed services exception. If the Court has no further questions?"
