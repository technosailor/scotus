And third, this case is not about whether there's some constitutional tort named malicious prosecution.  All we ask the Court to do is to affirm your numerous -- numerous suggestions made in Albright that the Fourth Amendment supports this cause of action, and bring the Seventh Circuit in line with all other -- with the Tenth Circuit ruling on this.",

But here, the Seventh Circuit's view of accrual flowed from its error as to the scope of the Fourth Amendment.  So to Justice Kagan's proposal that this go back, in many ways we think that's absolutely appropriate, because the Seventh Circuit erred by holding that since the Fourth Amendment stops at the time criminal process begins, it thought you can't have a malicious prosecution analogous claim, because there is no such Fourth Amendment claim.

The reason this came up to the Seventh Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in understanding the context -- this is on a motion to dismiss for -- for violation of the statute of limitations.  All of the claims were dismissed but one, the one that was appealed, and that one survived momentarily in the district court because Petitioner claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination element because it is malicious prosecution. He reiterated that claim before the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two conclusions. One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which they discuss, and that the only claim before them was based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing.  You have a Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it accrued too early; it is untimely. Now you're asking us to recognize a different breed of Fourth Amendment claim, namely, a malicious prosecution Fourth Amendment claim, because you'd like to overcome the time bar.  We do not recognize that Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim.",

And then in the last paragraph it says, \"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture.\" So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture. And at the very basic level, before you get into these questions of what's the accrual date or anything else, it seems that that's the thing that the Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment claim continues after arraignment or after legal process.  Now, when it accrues, when it doesn't accrue is a different question, but it's still a Fourth Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that's what the Seventh Circuit rejected.",

What the Court in context has read -- and by the way, this is consistent with past statements by the Seventh Circuit, the -- the fundamental statement the Court has made -- and this comes from Newsome, the 2001 decision from which this jurisprudence has blossomed in the Seventh Circuit -- relabeling a Fourth Amendment claim as malicious prosecution would not extend the statute of limitations. This has been the nature of the battle.  And on page 21 of the cert petition in this case, Petitioner makes clear why a question presented doesn't end halfway through.  It doesn't ask merely whether there's a Fourth Amendment right that survives the initiation of process. If, by \"process\" they mean Gerstein hearing, we agree.  And I think the Seventh Circuit would agree as well.  But it goes on to say, \"so as to allow for a malicious prosecution claim.\"  And on page 21 of their cert petition, they explain to the Court what they mean by that when they say that, \"The fate of this appeal to this Court turns on whether the Court does or does not adopt a favorable termination element,\" and that that's why this makes an ideal vehicle, to answer Justice Alito's earlier question, which is:  What are the elements of this claim?",

                "text": " Your Honor, let -- let answer it why it's not a good analogy, and I'll also answer -- I think flesh out just slightly whether or not this remains -- the moment in time when the police officers lie to -- to submit an affidavit with falsehoods to a magistrate at a Gerstein hearing, and the magistrate finds probable cause, what we do not dispute, and what we do not think the Seventh Circuit would dispute, is that that is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Now, the question of whether or not malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not. Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just slightly from a reliance on common law favorable termination, which is what most of the circuits on their side of the split have done.  This also goes, I think, to Your Honor's question and to your point. Most of the circuits on the other side of the split have used favorable termination, but they've done so by adopting it as part of the underlying four-element common law tort, and they think if that's what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable termination. A smaller number have relied on an extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision in Heck.  And that's the request now made by the Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be expanded to apply here. But Wallace was very clear.  Heck only applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the favorable termination element that comes with it apply only where you have an extant conviction.  And that doesn't exist here. The court went through a mental exercise. They said, look, if you can realize that you have a Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed accrual principle of Heck. And the reason was very simple.  Because as this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good convictions.  And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment protects the innocent as well as the guilty.  And expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then prove vindication at the end of the day would close the door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims and instances.",

                "text": " Well, Your Honor, just to sure that I've been clear, again, we do agree that the lie -- the second lie Your Honor has described, the lie before the magistrate, is actionable under the Fourth Amendment.  If the question is why then doesn't the accrual period run from when one is ultimately released, I would make a couple of points in response to Your Honor's question. First, Petitioner has been very careful not to make that argument.  Indeed, the continuing seizure idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert petition, which claimed they need the benefit of favorable termination to prevail.  They, of course, wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a period of a continuing seizure. Lower courts have rejected the notion of a continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here. And I think the reason may be twofold. The first is that it runs into -- it runs in the face of traditional accrual principles that this Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's not the period of harm that matters for accrual purposes.  It's when one first experiences the harm and thereby has all the elements needed to proceed. And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile work environment case, is really the exception that proves the rule.  In many ways it tells us why or how narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions to this typical accrual principle.  Hostile work environment does require precisely what Your Honor describes because it's impossible to know precisely when a hostile work environment begins.  Is it the second comment or the fifth or the tenth that someone has to endure in the workplace, and therefore, the Court is willing to consider it as a monolithic whole and treat it that way for accrual purposes. But again, that's the exception that proves the rule.  As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a continuing seizure. The final point I would make -- and I think this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely, the brief by Professor Alexandra -- taken to its logical conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the ultimate period of incarceration concludes.  And what that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs bringing claims 10, 15, 20 years down the road without any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability to maintain evidence and so forth.",

The other point -- and this is one that the States made in their amicus brief in Wallace.  They've made it again as have the municipalities as amici. They've made the point that early notice to the State as employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is extraordinarily important.  Government is intent upon learning sooner rather than later that they have individuals in their ranks that are violating the Constitution. And this Court in Wallace, in turning aside basically the same extension of Heck that is recommended for the Court, or the Court's invited to take in this very case, when they turned it away, they said one of the reasons is we need notice to the would-be defendants in those cases.  They can preserve evidence to ensure --",

Judge Rovner says there are ten other circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim, this kind of Fourth Amendment claim.  And she said, let's just assume that we do what those ten other circuits have done, which, of course, they didn't do, but she says let's just assume it.

And so the Fourth Amendment right will not be something that that plaintiff can vindicate.  That's the reason that Wallace didn't allow Heck to expand to instances like this where you're not challenging the wrongful conviction itself. And what they have asked, their claim is narrow, and the way to resolve this case is -- is now equally narrow.  The way to resolve the case is to conclude that whenever this -- your Fourth Amendment claim could run through the arraignment after indictment in this case, which still -- which was still out of the two-year limitations period.  But it doesn't -- it is not entitled to that favorable termination element which would have the effect of closing off the courthouse doors to a universe of claims in order to buy extra time in this case.  And that is what we urge the Court not to do.  And that is the simplest way.",

By no means does the limitations period, or is there a tolling that runs from the period of the lie at the Gerstein hearing through the pretrial period. As I said at the outset, that is subject to traditional tort common law principles of -- of proximate cause.  And there may well be damages recoverable for that period, but it's based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing.  And as Wallace held, Heck cannot be extended to apply to a claim that exists before you have an extant conviction.",

But with regard to the nature of the constitutional violation that occurs at subsequent processes, be they grand jury, bail hearings, preliminary hearings, those are traditional due process claims consistent with this Court's holding in Mooney -- frankly, in Brady, which has applied due process to prosecutorial duties and police duties during that period.
