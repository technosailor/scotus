So then the question, I guess, is what does it mean to discriminate, and I don't know that that necessarily means that there has to be some sort of injury. As I look at Bostock, you know, we have a -- a definition in Bostock that \"discriminate\" means roughly the same as it meant in 1964, \"to make a difference in treatment or favor of one as compared to others.\""

Am -- am I -- am I looking -- so I thought our opinion could say whatever injury requirement might exist with respect to certain kinds of other kinds of employment determinations, we took this case to focus on transfers, and with respect to transfers, we hold, and I guess you would have us hold, that it's enough under the statute that a person is transferred because of these protected characteristics.
