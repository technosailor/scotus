Now I admit and this Court has recognized that it can be a really fine line between the government soliciting messages from third parties to help shape its own message on the one hand and serving as a conduit for the third parties to express their own messages on the other.

But, more broadly speaking, I -- I -- I think it would be a little bit problematic if we allowed -- and realize I'm speaking on behalf of the United States here -- but we take this Court's cases to say that the First Amendment should not allow a government to evade the strictures of the First Amendment and the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination simply by being innovative in -- in its program or by fooling the public or by having a secret program on the side that only a few people know about. The fact is, once the government or the City of Boston here in particular has chosen to open up its flagpole for use by third parties, the First Amendment imposes certain restrictions on -- on how it can run that program."

It seems to me that when you think about the three factors from our case law, control does almost all of the work because, really, it's the informed observer knowing about the degree of control that the government exercises that, if we're creating this fiction, makes the informed observer think or not think that the speech is actually uttered on behalf of the government. Would you agree that control is the most important factor?"

But I think, in most cases, if what the city is doing or if what the governmental body is doing is simply inviting a diversity of viewpoints, then it's no longer government speech, and then it really does look like putting a stamp of approval. I guess an analogy I would give you is the difference between, say, a host symposium in which you're sort of curating who's going to speak, you might be inviting a diversity of views but within a narrow band and -- and you're exercising a lot of control versus hosting an open mic night, where you're just -- you have the mic available, you're serving as a conduit, and third parties can come and give their views. And I think that's the key question in this case, was Boston hosting a symposium of flags in its communities, or was it more like an open mic night?"
