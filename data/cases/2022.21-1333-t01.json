Your brief says that the immunity question, Section 230(c)(1)'s text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove third-party content. And I read the arguments in your brief and I read what you said about Stratton Oakmont and the sort of background, and so I thought your argument was that the -- that you can only claim immunity, Google, if the claim that's being made against you is about your failing to block or remove third-party content. To the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else, any of the, you know, hypotheticals that people have brought up, that's outside of the scope of the statute because, really, the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect Internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove, right?

Now, when you have that situation, the claim is fairly treating the website for publishing its own speech, and you can separate that out from the harm that's just coming from the information provided by another. And the danger which your hypotheticals has raised with express speech is where on that continuum any express speech may go because, unlike Google and YouTube, which are the two world's largest sites, we don't have a lot of endorsements and that kind of stuff, but other websites and other users use a myriad of topic headings and emojis that have different meanings that I'm not prepared and you would have to know what they mean, like kinds of checkmarks and, I don't know, high fives and all kinds of things. But the basic features of topic headings, \"Up next,\" \"Trending now,\" those kinds of things we would say are core, inherent -- they're no different than expressing what is implicit in any publishing, which is we hope you read this."

You don't -- you don't disagree that Congress was focused on offensive material, that that's sort of the basis of the whole statutory scheme. So, if we take as a given that we're talking about offensive material, it looks to me from the text of the statute that Congress is trying to immunize those platforms that are taking it down, that are doing things to try to clean up the Internet. And in the hypothetical that was just presented, we have a platform that is not only not taking it down in the way that the statute is focused on, it is creating a separate algorithm that pushes to the front so that more people would see than otherwise the offensive material. So how is that even conceptually consistent with what it looks as though this statute is about?"
