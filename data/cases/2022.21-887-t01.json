In this case, that settlement discussion happened, and, you know, the -- the -- there was a settlement discussion, and Miguel would have turned down a request to give up ADA rights without any compensation for those ADA rights. And the effect of Sturgis's rule is that if he accepts the settlement on the IDEA claim, it, like, automatically gets rid of -- it essentially gives the school a full release, a get-out-of-jail-free card on the ADA liability, and that's just not right.

And I think, in -- in these circumstances, it makes sense to -- to read that language the way you would apply -- you would look at the same words elsewhere in the IDEA, the -- the same word \"relief\" appears elsewhere, and it means what we say it means. That's the way the -- the word \"relief\" is used in other legal contexts. That's consistent and I think reinforced by the reasoning of Fry, which says that if you have to go to the hearing officer and the hearing officer would necessarily turn you away empty-handed, we don't want exhaustion in that circumstance. This Court's decision in Carr versus Sall announces the very common-sense principal, this is two terms ago, saying that it makes little sense to require litigants to present claims to adjudicators who are powerless to grant the relief requested."
