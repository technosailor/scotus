In 2019, that long-standing practice changed suddenly when the State chose to forbid any religion advisor from the execution chamber. Ramirez and other inmates fought to preserve their religious exercise rights to spiritual advisor presence, and while these challenges proceeded, the State withdrew Ramirez's 2020 execution date in exchange for withdrawal of his Section 1983 petition. Six months later, the State reset Ramirez's execution, followed two months after that by a reversion to allowing in chambers spiritual advisor presence."

But I -- I -- I think the -- just to answer your question directly, the question you asked my friend directly, we think the compelling interest here in this particular context is in carrying out the execution procedure effectively and -- which both means making sure it goes correctly for the prisoner and also making sure the purposes of the judgment are satisfied. And, obviously, even having a spiritual advisor in the chamber does create some degree of risk even if they're nine feet away, but I -- I think courts could probably set a minimum bar on risk tolerance."

Undoubtedly, because this is a very sensitive area of law and a very sensitive area of human experience, it's going to require -- it's going to require an examination of a lot of facts and circumstances around the individual.

I think perhaps one of the most alarming things that my friend General Stone said in his argument was that the TDCJ now has the affirmative power under their logic to front-run, impede, cut off, whatever you want to call it, the ability to file a 1983 case by their delay of the Level 2 exhaustion. The three most catalytic pages of this entire record and the lodged materials, 11, 12, and 13, it's also at page 53 of the Joint Appendix, and this is where Mr. Ramirez filed -- this was in June that he said the \"and pray over me\" language, it was denied in boilerplate on July 2. The August 19 -- 16 denial -- this is on page 13 -- has the exact same language. Someone literally just took the same typewriter and put the exact same thing and stamped there on August 16."

Under their own internal protocols, they could give themselves another 40 days to respond to it, in which case they would have returned the Level 2 grievance after Mr. Ramirez was already executed. That is the implication of how they are trying to construe exhaustion in this case. And there were several questions to me in my opening about what would the larger implications be for other cases. If this Court adopts Mr. Stone's logic, I predict you will see the word go out to prisons across the country that they now have this wonderful tool to insulate their policies, whatever they may be, from federal review under 1983 because they can put off the Level 2 grievance as long as they care to. I would point out -- Justice Kavanaugh, you asked me in my opening about the risk of, as you perceived, the non-TDCJ employee chaplains being greater than TDCJ employee chaplains."

There simply exists -- as far as everyone has looked for a hundred years, Justice Breyer, or longer, there is not a single instance of any chaplain ever causing any such disturbance."
