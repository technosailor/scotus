With respect to the balance between Factor 1 and Factor 4, I think Factor 4 plays a role when it comes to some of the very challenging hypotheticals that were put forward by Goldsmith and the government and by the Court. I don't think it's -- it's -- it's really that big a deal in this case, though, because this case really involves a very fundamental transformation in meaning or message and we think very little impingement on the market under Factor 4."

What I've heard you say a couple times is that the purpose of Warhol in this situation was to essentially convey a different meaning or message, that, you know, the original was conveying Prince in a vulnerable light and so the purpose was to convey him in a more iconic way.

The dicta that they're relying on is saying we think that when you have a parodic purpose and a parody in the process of shedding light, which I'm just quoting your words, shedding light on the original, you benefit society and create new meaning. But why you know and why all that matters in this case is they had an affirmative defense and they just didn't give you a good reason for copying. And why you know that Campbell just completely rules that out is what mattered in Campbell was exclusively the parodic purpose. If new meaning were and message were relevant, the Court would have been spending the whole time talking about the pretty woman you wanted to meet on the street versus all those not so pretty women you didn't want to meet on the street that were hairy, bald, two-timing Mr. Mix and one was pregnant and wasn't sure whose friend it was."

But the Campbell's Soup label, not only is it a completely different purpose because one's an advertising logo that goes on a supermarket shelf to a work of art, but -- and I think the government's brief says this -- he can't have used a generic soup can, he had to use the Campbell's Soup logo. Same as if he had picked Cheerios. It would have been really weird to do, I guess back then they didn't have the giant Cheerios, but you've got to use Cheerios to make your point about consumerism and brand loyalty."
