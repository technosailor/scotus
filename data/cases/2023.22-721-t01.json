In a lot of states, you might not have the same sort of defenses or states of mind that would so easily come into conflict, although, again, here, I think this is a rare circumstance. But, to get to your point, absolutely, a jury's general verdict of acquittal is one of the most sacrosanct things in American constitutional law, and we're not trying to undermine that at all. But I do think it's important to point out that that's simply not what happened here.

So we all acknowledge that there really is one fact that's being decided here, which is his insanity at the time of the crime, and the jury said yes and no. And just -- just to give one example of why I think McElrath's argument here is -- is a little bit formalistic, suppose the jury form were slightly different and suppose it had an option for guilt and then it had a different option for insanity, and they said guilty on all counts on insanity -- or on -- on the guilt question, but then, on insanity, they said yes and no."
