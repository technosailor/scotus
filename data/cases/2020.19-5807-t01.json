Your first sentence to us was, \"A verdict by a nonunanimous jury is no verdict at all.\" And then you talked about a verdict can be inaccurate and unfair even though it leads to the right decision.

And -- and -- and, you know, Justice Powell's decision is just a -- a unique opinion. It is one that requires us, if we -- if we are to follow it, to go -- to take a -- what's considered a -- a fundamental Bill of Right and marry it up to something that was foreclosed as at the time the opinion was given, and I just don't think that is something you'll ever see ever again. I -- I think, when we sit down people to explain that these are the two lines of precedent, Louisiana has a 10-2 system, do you think that would hold water, I think people would say no if they did not know about the Apodaca decision."

And the rule is not watershed because it is not essential to accuracy or a fair trial. After all, as the Chief Justice suggested at the outset of the argument, the right to a jury trial itself is not watershed, so subsidiary rights like that of a unanimous jury cannot be either. That result also reflects the purposes of federal collateral review."
