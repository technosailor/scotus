And that brings me to my third point about domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that application of domestic exhaustion principles here would prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be economically advantageous to both of them. And so the Respondent says, well, if I have had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I charge him less in return for his commitment to only use it once? And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant jurisdiction. The policy judgment that this Court has historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be unenforceable.",
