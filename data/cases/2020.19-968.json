  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In July 2016, Chike Uzuegbunam, a student at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC), began distributing religious literature in an outdoor plaza on GGC\u2019s campus. The campus police stopped him, however, citing GGC\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Expression Policy,\u201d which stated that students were generally permitted to engage in expressive activities only in two designated speech zones, and only after reserving them.</p>\n<p>Later, Uzuegbunam reserved one of the designated speech zones to speak to students about his religious beliefs, and campus police again stopped him. According to the police, he was exceeding the scope of his reservation by speaking in addition to handing out literature. After this incident, neither Uzuegbunam nor Joseph Bradford\u2014another GGC student who wishes to speak publicly on campus about his religious beliefs\u2014have attempted to speak publicly or distribute literature on campus.</p>\n<p>Uzuegbunam and Bradford filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the school\u2019s policies, both facially and as-applied, violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They also sought nominal damages for the violation of these rights. GGC filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and while that motion was pending, GGC revised its \u201cFreedom of Expression Policy\u201d to allow students to speak anywhere on campus without having to obtain a permit, except in limited circumstances. It also removed the portion of its student code of conduct that Uzuegbunam and Bradford had challenged. After making these changes, the school filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot.</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed the case as moot, concluding that the claims for nominal damages could not save otherwise moot constitutional challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Is a constitutional challenge to a school policy that seeks nominal damages rendered moot if the unconstitutional policy is revised during litigation?</p>\n",
