And the -- the last phrase in subparagraph (B) refers to \"such legal liability,\" which must be -- is cross-referencing the phrase in (A), \"pay for care and services available under the Medicaid plan.\" And as my hypothetical with Justice Thomas mentioned, many of the items, services, and care that a tortfeasor must pay for, whether we're talking about past or future medical expenses, are not covered by Medicaid.

And what we're arguing about is whether the state can go seek some other money, and the federal government is telling them they can't.

I suppose, I think that in theory, and I -- I admit that this seems kind of unrealistic, the beneficiary could just say, I don't want to accept these medical expense payments, I want to take my chances and go after the tortfeasor myself and use that to pay the medical expenses. And that actually happened in a case not with regard to a beneficiary but with a hospital that declined Medicaid -- Medicaid reimbursement and actually decided to seek the third-party recovery itself. So I do think that in the statute there is a notion that the assignment concerns, when it's -- when you're talking about assignment of a tort claim -- and this is a -- a common way of reasoning when you have conditions on the receipt of government funds -- I do think that there is a germaneness requirement, that when you're assigning a right to the state for -- specifically a right to a tort recovery, that it's not anything."

But the most important point is that the Medicare secondary payer statute in 1395y, 42 U.S.C. 1395y, similarly talks about providing Medicare an automatic right of subrogation when it comes to -- when -- when Medicaid makes certain payments and a private insurer may also be on the hook for those particular items or services.

The state's position here is a hyper-literal reading of the words \"any rights to payment for medical care.\" Reading that hyper-literally, it's not just a future tort; it's a future insurance policy, it's a future parent who's ordered to pay for some type of medical care. And under the state's reading, even if that future insurance policy is paying for things or -- or the parent is ordered to pay for things not covered by medical care -- I'm sorry, by Medicaid, the state told you today they could take it. So, for example, if Ms. Gallardo's father was ordered to pay for the special medical equipment that she needs to get to her appointments that is not covered by Medicaid, the state's position is that they could take that money.
