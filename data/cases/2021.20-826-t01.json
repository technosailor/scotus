And I understand why you don't want that, because that's not the way the Sixth Circuit decision reads, so it's unfair perhaps to ask you to answer this question because, you know, your client has a real interest in keeping this judgment. But, I mean, if just -- I guess -- I guess my question here is -- is, if one, you know, generally subsumes the other, but maybe contra-Ayala and contra-Fry we could imagine a case in which that wasn't true, just have the courts go through both and we'll be sure?"
