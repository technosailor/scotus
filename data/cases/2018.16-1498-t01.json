It just seems to me that if -- if the state court is saying that this is a transportation tax, and transportation is treaty-protected activity, it just kind of follows like almost, like, inevitably that there's -- there's preemption because, you know, you're taxing treaty-protected activity based on the statute as it's authoritatively construed by the state court. I just would like to say one thing about why I think that, you know, this -- what the state is doing here is quite inconsistent with what I think the expectation of the tribe would have been in 1855, because the tribe was actually specifically concerned about transporting fuel along this route, right? And so Governor Stephens promised in the treaty minutes, you can take your goods to market to the river, which is a reference to the Columbia River."

And I think that, you know, I haven't talked about the treaty canon so far because I think neutral principles are more than sufficient to resolve this case for Respondent, but at least under the -- the generous interpretation principles for Indians, I don't think that's what the Indians thought they were getting, that this exploitation of the travel on the very land they gave up, securing for themselves the right to travel across it. I think that it's very natural and consistent with what I think the expectation of the Yakamas would have been, that they could continue traveling across that land with their goods as they were already doing it at the time, and -- and that means -- that means transporting without paying a fee or owing an obligation to the states."
