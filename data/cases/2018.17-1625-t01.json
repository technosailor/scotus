The dispute is on \"costs\" because just as the full moon doesn't tell us anything about Mars and Venus, \"full costs,\" we submit, doesn't tell the court anything about fees and expenses. And Congress has been careful in separating out those concepts, and this Court has been careful in separating them out. Murphy, the case that involved costs under the IDEA, specifically contrasted the word \"costs\" with the word \"expenses\" and said \"expenses\" is open-ended and might include travel expenses and salaries and so forth, whereas costs, we know, are these things under Section 1920. And in Murphy, the Court told all of us, the lower courts and the bar, and Congress, what it takes to override that presumption. The Court said, and this is a quote from page 301, \"No statute will be construed as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs unless the statute refers explicitly to witness fees.\" So here, in Section 505, Your Honors, we have a statute that does not refer explicitly to witness fees and, under a plain application of Murphy, cannot authorize witness fees."

The first type of case are statutes that impose some sort of limitation on costs. So an example would be the first statute, a Kentucky statute providing \"the plaintiff shall recover his full costs although the damages do not exceed 40 shillings.\" There were a number of statutes that said, if your damages were not above a certain threshold, you would get no more cost than damages."

So the word \"full\" in that phrase tells you, even though the plaintiff is only getting half of the recovery, nevertheless, the plaintiff gets their full costs."

There is a statute called -- there's a case called Avery, which interprets the Copyright Act of -- I think it was 1842 or something like that, and it says there is no understood distinction between costs that can be awarded in a statute that mentions full costs and one that just mentions costs. And that's true in the Copyright Act going back to the statute of Anne in 1709, which is the predecessor to all early American copyright law. Now, Justice Breyer, you made the point that it's very expensive in many cases to litigate these issues."

But they all also specifically mention attorneys' fees, which is a big problem on Respondents' side because, if full costs already meant total compensation, there would have been no point in expressly adding attorneys' fees.

And, to be honest, had Congress taken the word \"full\" out of the statute in 1976, no doubt someone would have used that fact to argue, well, clearly, Congress was displeased with the broad copyright cost awards and, therefore, would have used it to argue for a narrower rule.

The -- probably the best case that tells you something about what was going on, at least between 1831 and 1853, is a case called Ferrett against Atwill that's cited by my friends in their brief, and this is Justice Nelson riding on circuit.

Just to illustrate that the adjective can make a big difference, if you think about the Weyerhaeuser case, and the adjective wasn't critical but was potential, potential habitat, I mean, habitat would still have a meaning, but I think the case would be very different. But I think what's more telling here is I think what the dispute here is we say that Congress in 1831, in 1909, in 1976 used the phrase \"full costs\" capaciously and used the word \"costs\" in its ordinary meaning. My friends on the other side say, no, \"cost\" was being used in a term of art sense. I think you look to the adjective in this case to tell you which of us is right. And I think there are --"

When Congress uses the phrase with the modifier \"full,\" I sure would have thought that's an indication that Congress means to adopt the broader reading and not the narrow reading that is the term of art. And I think if you look at this from every relevant historical standpoint, which I think is 1831, 1909, and 1976, it all points you in favor of the ordinary meaning construction of costs. So, in 1831, the one thing we ought to be able to agree on is Congress was not using costs in 1831 in a narrow sense to refer to some other federal statute that provided a schedule of fees, because there wasn't one for another 20 years. So I assume, consistent with this Court's cases, that when Congress used the term \"full costs\" in 1831, it was using it in its ordinary meaning, which would have covered all of the costs of litigation, and my friend's efforts to superimpose a narrow party-to-party costs framing on that is simply not borne out by the historical practice, as that Ferrett case shows, and I know it's not a lot, but it's all anybody has. So I think it is clear that, between 1831 and 1853, ordinary costs was -- rather, \"full cost\" was being construed in its ordinary meaning way. Then we get to 1909, a major revision of the statute."

But, as to the 1984 legislative history, the reason I think this is compelling even to those that don't generally look at legislative history is because think about what the senator there is doing in expressing the views of the committee. The committee, if you believe legislative history at all, very much wants to provide for the recovery of \"investigatory fees,\" is the term he uses."

And this is not a spending power case. So, if you were inclined to find a distinction from Murphy, I think most of your textualist colleagues would say: Legislative history is never going to overcome a clear statement test, ever. But, you know, some of them, not all of them, but some of them will take a peek at the legislative history when you're not dealing with a clear statement rule; you're just trying to get the best meaning of the statute, particularly when the legislative history supports a ruling or a reading of the statute that avoids rendering an important part of it superfluous. So I think you could distinguish Murphy on that ground, but I also want to say that we don't take issue with Murphy when it's dealing with the word \"costs\" unmodified, and that is a very familiar formulation."

So I think that discretion is another part of this administrability answer, but I also think it's important to recognize that there are statutes that say things like all expenses or non-taxable costs, so courts are going to have to figure out rules to deal with that.

And I think, in an odd way, the fact that we all understand that taxable costs are just a subset of the ordinary meaning of costs actually helps reinforce the idea that full costs means something more than the subset. I mean, I think if you think of a word like full membership, well, full membership probably means full membership, but if it's used in contradistinction to observer status or provisional membership, you absolutely know you mean the whole thing. In the same way, the reference to \"full cost,\" precisely because there is a universe of taxable costs out there, is a reference to both taxable and non-taxable costs. I mean, another way of thinking about this is we all refer to 1920 as taxable costs, but we could equally and accurately refer to it as partial costs."
