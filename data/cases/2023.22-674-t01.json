So why not issue a blank NTA because they're hard -- they're -- they're a pain, we've found them difficult, then issue a compliant notice of change, show up on a date certain, and then remove about a third of the aliens in this country without any notice of the charges against them or their right to counsel or anything else, and then deal with the remainders and file compliant notices to appear in those cases?"

I understood you to respond to Justice Kavanaugh by saying that the government's position is that the stop-time rule gives the government a procedural advantage, the ability to thwart the accrual of time, and so that's why the government has to dot all the I's and -- and cross all the T's with respect to that. But I guess I see this as exactly -- \"this\" meaning in absentia removal -- as exactly the same thing, because, ordinarily, a non-citizen would be entitled to a hearing where he or she could make an argument and advocate for themselves about removal, and the statute allows the government to get around that in a sense by allowing the -- the government to get a removal order in the absence of adversarial presentation by the person who doesn't show up. And so I guess what I'm trying -- still struggling with is why we would have a world in which a statute that requires the government to give notice in order to be able to get a removal in absentia order would allow for that notice to be deficient in any way. Justice Barrett talked about the different ways in which it might be deficient, but why -- why could the government give deficient notice in order to get the benefit of in absentia removal when we've already held that the government can't give deficient notice to get the benefit of the stop-time rule?"

In that circumstance, the government can prove by clear and convincing evidence removability, the non-citizen has no clue what the charges against him are. And where, as in Niz-Chavez, the argument was that a deficient NTA was nonetheless sufficient to stop the clock for discretionary relief, here, the government is arguing that same deficient NTA is somehow sufficient for the far more draconian sanction of removing a non-citizen without ever hearing their side of the story. Because the statute doesn't contemplate that result, because it requires a complete valid paragraph (1) notice in every case, and contemplates a paragraph (2) notice only as a supplement to that valid paragraph (1) notice, this Court should reject the government's arguments again.
