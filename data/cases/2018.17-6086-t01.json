And to get back to -- to the -- to the colloquy I was having with Justice Gorsuch, I do think at the end of the day this is not a provision that just lays out a general standard and then requires all of the fleshing in. That, the Court has held, is permissible, provided you supply a general policy. But it really is inside even that, because Congress set up a pretty reticulated scheme, made a lot of judgments along the way."

And, of course, some substantial portion of the 4,000 convictions at issue would be in -- in -- in jeopardy of being vacated either on direct or collateral review. SORNA's efficacy, if Petitioner prevails, will not just be sharply curtailed. It will arguably be thoroughly gutted as -- as a matter of how this federal law works. And if it is possible, and we think it is not just possible but the most natural interpretation of the Attorney General's authority to say this is a narrow authority, to specify the applicability of requirements in an on/off way in order to get people into the system, and that interpretation avoids constitutional problems, right, it's constitutional, if we read it to say do it to the extent you can, then, as Petitioner concedes, I think if that's -- if it's possible to read the statute that way, that's constitutional and that's what we would urge the Court to do.

Just to pick up where my friend left off, I want to emphasize that prior to SORNA's enactment, every single state had an existing sex offender registry and those will continue to exist and to require the registration of offenders, regardless of what happens with Individuals like Petitioner were required to register under existing state law, and they will still be required to register. This was a law whose retroactive application was opposed by the states, which is part of the reason why only 18 states have implemented it. States spoke out against the retroactive application of the law before the Attorney General made his determination. And so states themselves, who are the experts in this area having run registration systems for years, don't want this Act to be fully retroactive. My friend emphasized that this delegation was all about practicality, but the reality is, is that the Attorney General's promulgated rule does not account for practicality in any way, which is further evidence for this Court that to the extent feasible was not the standard of this delegation. That is not the standard that exists in the text."
