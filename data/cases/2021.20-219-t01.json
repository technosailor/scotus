And then you apply that general rule and you can apply it to the broad category of contracts that protect against non-pecuniary interests -- that protect, pardon me, non-pecuniary interests, or you can apply it even more specifically with respect to discrimination.

So it doesn't need to worry about the specific -- a specific category of compensatory damages. So, for example, in this case, if this Court says you were wrong to say that you can just never obtain compensation for emotional distress, that no victim of discrimination in violation, no matter how egregious the discrimination is, no victim can ever obtain compensation for emotional distress, then that would go back down and there might be questions about whether, here, we really had the kind of deliberate indifference, the kind of intentional conduct that's necessary to trigger a damages remedy at all. I just want to -- to go back to the point about emotional distress damages and the -- and the possibility that they might be -- go too high, because I think Respondent places a lot of stress on this. And I want to echo what my colleague emphasized, which is that we have had 30 years of these kinds of damages being available, and while -- while Respondent and their amici attempt to cite examples of high awards with respect to emotional distress, they just aren't from this family of statutes. And you have to assume that they've been boiling the oceans looking for sort of exorbitant awards, and they're not finding them. And that's because there are checks on that kind of award. So, as I was just explaining, as a preliminary matter, you can't even get your foot in the door for compensatory damages until you show intentional conduct in violation of the clear terms of a statute."

There certainly are some jurisdictions in which there are certain specific categories of exceptions: common carriers, innkeepers, cases involving death messages sent by telegram and the like. Typically, what's been going on in those cases is that courts have looked to tort law and have imposed a heightened and extra contractual duty alongside the contractual duty in light of the personal interests that are implicated by the particular context, by the relationships at issue. Now, again, I think, if you look at the treatises, the state of the law to this day is unsettled, and there have been jurisdictions that have kind of moved back and forth."

The second and separate argument is kind of this ratification-light argument that is made by the other side and that my friend, Ms. Sinzdak, made very heavily during her argument today, which is this argument that because there were cases that seemed to assume the existence of emotional distress damages, that Congress, at least by the time of the ACA, should somehow be understood to have ratified those cases.

In Gebser, the Court drew a distinction between, I believe, Title VII and Title IX, and the Court said, well, outside the Spending Clause context, antidiscrimination statutes are often centrally about providing compensation. By contrast, Spending Clause statutes are really about providing equal access and ensuring the parties that receive federal funds provide equal access to federal programs."

And, indeed, if you take a look at the Corbin treatise, the Corbin treatise says in its discussion of this very issue that the line between emotional distress damages and punitive damages is \"indistinct and hard to draw.\" And, indeed, I think, if you look to jurisdictions that permit punitive damages and not emotional distress damages, those courts are essentially using punitive damages as a proxy for emotional distress damages and, conversely, some of the courts that have permitted emotional distress damages have noted that they have a punitive and deterrent effect.

And, of course, nowadays we have the distinct tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, which will be available under state law in many of these cases.

My point, as I indicated in the opening, is that there is no uniform practice on Congress's part, and I think that the statutes fall into three categories. First, there are statutes, and I think the best examples are Section 1983 and the Fair Housing Act, where emotional distress damages are permitted."

Now Title VII is, I think, perhaps the most significant example because, of course, Title VII when it was first enacted did not provide for compensatory damages at all, and when Congress amended it in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress did so very carefully. It imposed caps, including some quite strict caps particularly with regard to small employers, on the availability not just of emotional distress damages but also punitive damages and other forms of non-economic damages more generally.

And I think the Court can have some degree of comfort that, if the Court were not to permit emotional distress damages here, it would not be going further than Congress has in other statutes. Quite to the contrary, what the Court would be doing is very similar to what Congress has done in other bedrock antidiscrimination statutes."
