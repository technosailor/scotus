Therefore, the only way that Wyoming's statehood could have terminated the hunting right is by implication, but that is the very theory that this Court repeatedly rejected in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians. And while the treaty does provide that the right would terminate if the lands were no longer unoccupied, President Cleveland's 1897 proclamation creating the Bighorn National Forest did not suddenly render all 1.1 million acres of the land comprising the forest occupied as the parties to the treaty understood that term. As a result, the treaty right has not terminated, and Petitioner should have been permitted to invoke that right during his criminal prosecution for hunting in the Bighorn National Forest. Before this Court, Wyoming largely disregards Mille Lacs and urges this Court to rely on its 1896 decision in Ward v. Race Horse."

Nothing since Repsis, including the decision by this Court in Mille Lacs, merits a -- an exception to this Court's repeated command that, once the appeals are over, a final judgment binds the parties and they may not renew the same dispute in another forum. Repsis ruled that this particular treaty right had expired, and this Court should not on collateral review allow it to spring back, especially as, when you look at the decision in Mille Lacs, Mille Lacs went out of its way not to overrule the result in Race Horse. Much of -- much of the -- the argument over preclusion, Your Honor, has to do with whether there has been a change in intervening law, and this case is particularly ill-suited to find such a change. The treaty text has not changed. There are no essential facts that have changed, because, when one looks at the underlying case brought by the Crow Tribe, in the complaints and the Joint Appendix, it was brought at the broadest possible level of abstraction."

Now earlier in the opinion the Court had said: We concluded that the particular rights in the Race Horse treaty at issue there were not intended to survive statehood. Then on 207/208: The Race Horse Court's decision that Indian treaty rights were impliedly repealed by Wyoming statehood was informed by that court's conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty over natural resources and, thus, that Congress could not have intended the rights to survive statehood. And that's an important last phrase of that sentence because it's tying the entire Race Horse holding to this mistaken premise that Indian treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources. I think that's a key sentence. And I think, frankly, that kind of undercuts a lot of the idea that even the holding -- this second holding of Race Horse is still viable."

And certainly, under the Indian canons of construction, that's a reasonable reading that is entitled to be given to the Indians. And the last point on conservation necessity, you know, this discussion I think just demonstrates that if the Court finds that the -- the treaty right is valid and has not been terminated, Wyoming still has the ability to regulate its -- its wildlife, its natural resources, simply according to the conservation necessity standard like every other state already has to do."
