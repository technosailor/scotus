That reading is confirmed by this Court's decision in Gustafson, which held that it's more reasonable to interpret the liability provisions of the '33 Act as providing remedies for violations of the obligations it had created, not as imposing liabilities independent of the substantive obligations of the Act. Respondent's contrary interpretation would run roughshod over the core statutory distinction between registered and exempt shares, which is fundamental to the structure and operation of the '33 Act, and it would dramatically expand the scope of liability, disrupt the capital formation process, and upset settled expectations by overturning decades of case law and SEC interpretation consistently holding that plaintiffs must prove they purchased registered shares. Respondent can't identify a single case in the 90-year history of the Securities Act imposing Section 11 liability on exempt shares."

The question here is the precise nature of that relationship. Petitioners say \"such security\" refers exclusively to what they call registered shares. But the statute doesn't use that term or provide a definition for it, and neither do Petitioners. That might seem unnecessary because one would think that a registered share is one specified in the registration statement, but registration statements do not specify individual shares, as exemplified by the examples of Petitioner Butterfield's shares that we discuss in our brief. Instead, what registration statements do is they do not act at the individual -- at the level of individual shares."

The difference between that solution and what they're proposing is that if you adopt their view, they don't only cut off liability after the end of the lockup period; they can, simply by having a limited exception to the lockup period on day one, eliminate all liability altogether, including for all the shares in the IPO, because as soon as they let a single share, exempt share, onto the market, which they can easily do, it doesn't harm their interest of the underwriters because they don't have to let enough in that's going to affect the share price, as soon as they let in even a small number of shares, we've got this intermingling that they say requires tracing that they say is impossible to do, and the Fifth Circuit has agreed. You know, they've been a little bit careful about how hard they think tracing is in this Court, but you can rest assured that if this Court issues a decision in their favor, they're going to be arguing to the lower courts that you need to adopt the position in Krim, and -- and then we'll be at the end of it."
