We know there have been a number of court of appeals decisions that have upheld the constitutionality of the qui tam suits, but they have all first interpreted the dismissal power to apply whether or not the government proceeds with the action, whether or not the government initially declines or comes into the case later, and they have noted how that right is important in their view to allow the executive to maintain the necessary control over the suit.

And so on the judgment before you is a case in which the court of appeals found not only that intervention was required, but it was satisfied and good cause was there, and it does deal with a lot of the textual issues regarding the structure of the provisions and the surplusage to say the government needs to intervene, but then, once it intervenes under (c)(3), it goes back into the -- the world of (c)(1) and (c)(2), where it has the power to dismiss. We note the -- the court of appeals, both the Third Circuit in this case and the Seventh Circuit have required intervention, and they've said it's usually going to be a low bar for the government because good cause is a flexible standard, and we can take into account Article II separation of powers concerns when we are apply -- when we are applying good cause. And so we think that should go a long ways to addressing the government's concern of what would happen if good cause is too heightened of a standard and would make it too difficult for the government to intervene. If I -- I could, I could respond to -- to the government's position that as I understand on the constitutional position is that the -- that the relator is not exercising government power because it's a private individual. But we don't think that should be the constitutional analysis."

And so we think it's even more important that the Attorney General has substantial oversight over a private person litigating on behalf of the United States when -- when we clearly know that the -- the interest that the -- that the private relator is most concerned about is the financial stake that he may have in the case."

The final point I'll make is that if there is a hearing and if we're wrong on our main theory -- and I -- I -- I hope the Court reconsiders -- then I think the constitutional standard is at least baked into that statute. It's implicit in saying that the government has to come up with some basis for dismiss that is nonarbitrary and that is rational.
