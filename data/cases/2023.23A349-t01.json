The specter of lesser participation in the federal plan revealed yet another problem. The EPA's choice of method, that is, selecting a single cost threshold and applying it uniformly across all 23 states to establish emissions limits, has consequences; namely, the math doesn't work when the inputs  don't match the outputs.  With the SIP disapprovals in flux and the EPA's methodology requiring full  participation, the EPA had an obligation to consider what happens to the federal plan when one or more states drop out, that is, when the inputs, 23 states, don't match the outputs, now the 11 states that remain in the plan.  Its failure has become consequential. The plan now regulates under half of the states and a quarter of the emissions that the EPA originally set out to regulate.  Under this fractured plan and without a stay, the remaining states and their industries face serious harm.  I welcome the Court's questions."

With respect to the Clean Air Act itself, it ties publication in the Federal Register to final agency action that is reviewable under the Clean Air Act's judicial review provisions.  Second, by the EPA's own words in the prepublication notice it presented in March, the EPA noted that that would not be the final rule  for the purpose of compliance, and, in fact, that would fail the second prong of this Court's Bennett test because legal consequences did not flow from that.  But I also  want to take a step back because, even if this Court disagrees with me as to whether the stays fall into or out of the gambit of what the agency had to consider, the fact that the commenters previewed all of the problems with respect to the SIP disapprovals and cautioned that the federal plan's uniformity would -- would falter, and then very quickly afterwards there was confirmation of that through litigation that popped up all around the country before the rule even  --the federal plan was in a prepublication form.  All of that cued the agency into its obligation to address this very serious structural flaw with the federal plan."

Now that methodology, again, goes well deep into the technical support documents, in part because the EPA engaged in a sort of capacious way of talking about the methodology, but it's there.  And the ozone transport policy analysis goes down the details of how the c ost threshold is specific to the mix of states that goes into it.  And when that shifts, the EPA has an obligation to assess why it matters or why that cost threshold is still reasonably applied to any remaining states.  It has not done so.  This is  -- the burden is on the EPA to consider the inflexibilities that it introduced into the plan, and it has failed to do so, and it continues to stick its head in the sand by failing to go back to the drawing board."

Then there's the question of, well, even if you couldn't comment but  --because you didn't know enough, should you have filed a motion for reconsideration?  And you didn't file a motion for reconsideration.  Then there's this very complex issue about how your question relates to the validity of the SIP disapprovals themselves because, if the SIP disapprovals were valid, you wouldn't have a leg to stand on here.  So how are we supposed to know that in this posture?  So I guess what I'm saying is there are so many hoops that you have to go through and you have to go through all of them.

Now, why that matters, I gave you two reasons:  the unique statutory circumstance, as well as the EPA's choice of method.  The statute itself requires the EPA to look back to prior predicate rulemaking in order to assert its authority to have a federal plan, and necessarily baked into that is the fact that there may be judicial intervention, especially by the EPA's own doing."

If EPA is regulating beyond that authority, it is regulating beyond the statute.  Ms. Sridharan has explained the deficiencies in a broken rule in which 90 percent of power plant emissions, 75 percent of total emissions, have been taken out of the plan.  But the Court also asked whether the emissions controls in the rule are reasonable regardless of the number of states that are involved.  The answer is no for three primary reasons.  First, the rule selectively ignores EME Homer's cost -effectiveness framework. Second, the rule over- controls across a number of industries.  And, third, the rule imposes an impossible compliance timeline that will result in reliability issues across the country.  I welcome the Court's questions."

But, to your question of Ms. Sridharan, I think the issue that you were looking for is evidence about what EPA did, and I want to point you to 88 Federal Register 36741.  Excuse me.  \"When the effects of\"  -- I'm quoting.  \"When the effects of these emissions  reductions are assessed collectively across the hundreds of EGU and non- EGU industrial sources that are subject to this rule, the cumulative improvements in ozone levels at downwind receptors, while they may vary to some extent,  are both measurable and meaningful.\"  That is the best example of the collective question that EPA asked itself and answered.  Now, you know, Justice Sotoma yor, you asked the question about cost and whether the obligations, for example, in Ohio would be the same.  But I think the question here is -- goes back to what this Court approved in EME Homer. It's not just a question about whether EPA can regulate something that is inexpensive, potentially inexpensive.  It's not a question about whether EPA can regulate emissions.  It's a question about whether EPA has appropriately calculated what it calls that knee in the curve, the point where the emissions contribution to a downwind state is controlled at a reasonable cost level.  So I think the exchange that you had with Ms. Sridharan about where that cost issue comes from has to do with the question about, if  you've got 23 states and all of their EGUs and all of the non -EGU sources that are linked into this rule all feeding into that cost question,  what happens if you take out the states where maybe you can control those costs most cheaply  and you're left with states th at actually have much higher cost thresholds to impose on industries or on EGUs?  That changes the cost calculus.  It also changes, of course, the emissions calculus.  And I want to point in particular --"

I read the  -- I read these applications pretty carefully, and I didn't understand this cost argument at all.  And I'm really simplistic.  I don't have a math degree, all right?  If you're sharing costs among 23 people, your cost is going to be less.  If you' re sharing costs among 11 people, your cost is going to be more.  So, since this plan doesn't change any allocations depending on the number of people who are in it, states are bound by the number that was calculated on the larger group, how are the remaining states affected by the fact that  their cost should have been higher, but it's not because it's been fixed at this lower number?"

What we're talking about when it comes to meaningful reductions is on the order of a total of .66 parts per billion averaged across all of these receptors.  Now there's a bigger number involved. That number is, if you add all of the reductions from the receptors from Arizona to Connecticut and you add them up, then you get a bigger parts per billion number, but that's like ticketing me for speeding if I exceed the speed limit one mile per hour in 23 different states.

It seems to me that even just sort of irreparable harm, as we've defined it, is insufficient to have the Supreme Court ask -- acting as a first decider on the merits of an issue that hasn't been addressed by the lower court.
