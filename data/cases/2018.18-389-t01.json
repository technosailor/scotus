And so, when a state is applying its law in its sovereign territory, I would say it's understandable and laudable that the federal government wants to say: Well, your state law can apply if it's more demanding. But that principle is completely out of place on the Outer Continental Shelf, where all law is federal law. We have a third reason, which I'm happy to get out, which is Congress also knows -- and we have some statutes collected at Footnote 3 of the blue brief -- Congress actually knows how to enact a -- call it a super-savings clause or a savings clause that's specific to federal enclaves."

So I tend to think that I'm in pretty good company on my understanding of federal enclave law, but I do understand federal enclave law very -- very succinctly as this, which is, when you have a new federal enclave, you don't borrow state law as a general matter and you specifically don't borrow state law when there's federal law on the same matters, which I think is the language right from McGlinn."

It's really that the Congress in 1825 addressed criminal law because they had a particular problem that they didn't have with civil law, right? Which is the United States v. Hudson case, which says you can't have common law crimes. So Congress was forced to act with respect to criminal law, and when it acted, what I'd say it did with the Assimilated Crimes Act is it reflected the broader principle, which is it didn't say we're going to apply federal criminal law and state -- rather, borrow state criminal law even where we have an on-point federal criminal statute."

Instead, it creates one body of law, a body of federal law, and it adopts state law as \"the law of the United States\" to the the extent it is applicable and not inconsistent with other federal law. Now, as this Court and virtually every other court has recognized for 50 years, those words refer to gap-filling in federal law. Respondent's position, by contrast, would essentially replicate the position on mainland California on the Outer Continental Shelf, with the small exception that federal officials would enforce the law, which we think is inconsistent with the text, the purpose, and the history of -- of OCSLA."

                "text": "We -- we do know that OCSLA, however, was a compromise, and the compromise was between having state control over the law of the Outer Continental Shelf and federal law, but federal law did not encompass all of the legal relationships and matters that concern human endeavors. And that's why what Congress did was to incorporate state law as federal law, with federal law having supremacy and the Secretary having the authority to issue the appropriate regulations. And if I could just start there, the first sentence of Section 1334(a), in answer to your question, Justice Sotomayor, reads as follows: \"The Secretary shall ... prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out such provisions.\" I'm astonished that the other side thinks that that language isn't broad enough to displace any state rule that gets in the way of what the federal government deems to be necessary. We know through practice that the EPA is regulating Outer Continental Shelf air emissions that are prescribed by California, and it is doing so pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. There are memorandum of understanding between the Secretary of Interior and the Coast Guard and the EPA and the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that concern the interrelationships of how law enforcement occurs with state law as the substance of what is being enforced. That happens every day in the National Park Service, where national park rangers are enforcing hunting and fishing rules that are prescribed by states."

And so what we're talking about is a very fluid situation, if you will, between workers who might go to a rig within the three-mile limit and be governed exclusively by state law one shift, come back onshore, then go back out to a shift that would be on the Outer Continental Shelf. And the question is, what legal regime is going to cover those people? And it's quite -- quite sensible why Congress would have said, substantively, we think that the state law ought to apply, but, to the extent that the Secretary of Interior perceives there to be inconsistencies with the federal standard, we're going to give the Secretary the authority, regulatory authority, to displace that standard."

Now the word \"applicable\" I do think has meaning, and the other side fluctuates between it being surplusage or irrelevant or whatever, but I do want to point out that it's not just applicable state law that the federal -- that the Secretary is administering, it's also applicable federal law. So, if the word \"applicable\" really does mean gap-filling, you strain to wonder how is it that the Secretary is supposed to determine what applicable law is if you give it an authoritative construction that the word \"applicable\" means gap-filling, because then you have a complete contradiction and you have read the statute in a -- a very bizarre way, because, ordinarily, what the Secretary is doing is reading the word \"applicable\" federal law to decide does the Clean Air Act apply."
