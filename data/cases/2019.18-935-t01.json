The point is where habitual residence is disputed in those small fraction of cases, there's very little ex ante guidance that's going to be useful, except to say the question is, where does the child usually live or, if it helps to think of it this way, where is the child at home?

That's obviously a significant gap. Petitioner cites some cases saying that a child may not have a habitual residence, but I think it's important to point out that those statements were made in a very different context, which is actually the one presented in the very large majority of decided Convention cases, and that's the situation where the child and the parents live together in country A, then the child moves to country B with one or both parents -- it could be a temporary stay with grandparents, could be for a job -- and then the parent who was with the child in country B says, I'm not sending the child back."

First of all, I think it's important to unpack the phrase \"shared parental intent.\" I think the way the lower courts, as we discuss in our brief, the low -- the way the lower courts of the United States have applied that is what's the intent of each parent that can be proven by words, deeds, objectively, what's the -- what is the parents' intent with respect to the location of the child? That none -- there's perhaps one case in which a -- a federal court of appeals indicated that -- that a meeting of the minds might be necessary, and even that court relied on an alternative ground. So I think the -- the question is, is the intent of the parents with respect to where the child lives relevant? I think, yes, it can be proved they don't have to have jointly agreed."

So the question would be: Are there other facts that would be cognizable under the habitual residence standard that the lower courts didn't address? And our submission is those other facts are all facts that weigh in favor of Italy because they're principally the fact that the child has been located in Italy for her whole life before she was removed. And that's not something that was relevant necessarily to intent, but that's clearly a highly important fact that she was there with both parents. And so we don't see any other facts that could be adduced in this record."

This Court need look no further than the parties' stipulation at JA 28 and JA 29 that, as early as August of 2014, Monasky was already laying the groundwork for her return to the United States by looking for U.S. healthcare and child care options, U.S. employment, and U.S. divorce lawyers. This Court need look no further than JA 200 and JA 217, which are emails between the parties sent in the critical days preceding and following A.M.T.'s birth, where Monasky reiterated her intent to return to the United States and to divorce Taglieri. And this Court need look no further than Pet. App. 94a, where the district court found that Monasky intended to return to the United States with A.M.T. as soon as possible. That's precisely what she did."
