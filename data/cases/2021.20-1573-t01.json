So courts are very good at dealing with those kind of discovery issues. Arbitrators are very bad at dealing with class-wide discovery. And, at the same time, given the high stakes because of the aggregation of the claims, if I'm a defendant and you're telling me I can't escape this kind of aggregate litigation, it's going to happen, it's going to happen to me either in arbitration or in litigation, then I'm going to pick litigation every time because I get lots of additional judicial review and judicial remedies available to me there, and what that's going to mean in practice is that arbitration is going to wither on the vine."

So it -- it's -- it's maybe from the perspective of my clients a happy coincidence that this anomalous claim that nobody else has that, you know, blends procedure and substance in weird ways, I mean, you know, you keep calling it substantive, but California calls it procedural. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter because this is a claim that because it aggregates all these multitude of claims involving distant employees, puts them all in one proceeding, gives you class action discovery as wide as class actions, it does all that. It's just it's -- it's nothing that looks like the kind of thing that's suitable for bilateral arbitration. And since Congress protected the ability of parties to agree to bilateral arbitration, no matter how much California thinks it's got a better way to do things, it just has to yield when it comes to people who are parties to arbitration agreements. As to other people, as to employees who are not subject to the FAA and the like, they can have their policy, and, subject to the Due Process Clause, there's not much my clients can do with it, about it. But, if they have a binding, valid arbitration agreement to resolve their disputes bilaterally, I think that should carry the day under the FAA."

Now, sure, PAGA claims, like a lot of other claims that are arbitrated, are -- they may involve high stakes, although, in PAGA's case, that's ameliorated by the fact that unlike in a class action or a collective action, where the recovery is dictated by the proof as to the damages of all those -- those third parties, in a PAGA action, the base penalty is set by just mechanical proof of the number of violations per pay period, and the adjudicator has discretion to limit those penalties, regardless of what some third party might want, if -- if the result would be unjust, arbitrary, and oppressive or confiscatory."

I agree with my friend that -- that the state's characterization for -- for purposes of the particular issue that was in front of it in the Amalgamated case of the right as being procedural versus substantive would not control the same question in a federal court either for Erie purposes or for purposes of the FAA to the extent that substantive versus procedural is an important part of the FAA analysis. But, as to the nature of the claim, its requisites, what -- what it is for and -- and how it proceeds, on those aspects, I think the Court is bound by California law. Now the -- the -- the Iskanian decision, I think, kind of -- had kind of an interesting passage where the California Supreme Court said, you know, we think perhaps that -- that if what the state was trying to do was -- was just a subterfuge to avoid the FAA, that you might be able to -- to kind of look through the -- the, you know, statute that provided for collective proceedings aggregating individual claims under the, you know, sort of false flag label, that it was -- that it was something different."

So claim preclusion is not, you know, individual violation by individual violation under PAGA. I want to -- I -- I want to talk a little bit more about this -- this question of -- of substance versus procedure because, as my friend noted, you know, substance and procedure may mean different things in different contexts. And I think what's critical in the FAA context, what the -- what the Court has described as substantive and as the kind of substantive claim that an individual does not waive by agreeing to arbitrate a -- a case rather than litigate it is the right to pursue a statutory remedy. And that's clearly what this -- this agreement waives for -- for Ms. Moriana and for the state to the extent that -- that she represents its interests in a particular manner. It does not permit her to -- to pursue that statutory remedy. And there's nothing in -- as I think Justice Breyer pointed out, in any of the -- the Court's precedents in this area where the Court has -- has said that an arbitration agreement, which is by nature supposed to be enforced insofar as an issue is referable to arbitration, and then that issue is to be arbitrated according to the terms of the agreement, that -- that that arbitration agreement can be used as a vehicle for extinguishing a right to a remedy that is not under the terms of the arbitration agreement referable to arbitration."

So the -- the spider applies to every kind of agreement. But then the -- then the next question is: Okay, but, nonetheless, would there be something -- is there something about that that -- that -- that has an adverse impact on arbitration specifically? And that then gets to the question, is -- is a representative action where a representative pursues on a bilateral basis claims that may involve events affecting multiple individuals, is that inconsistent with what Congress meant in 1925 when it said arbitration? And we know the answer to that is no because one of the familiar types of arbitration in 1925 was representative arbitration pursued bilateral between labor representatives and employers, between representatives of agricultural cooperatives and employers. It was -- it was not something like a class action, a modern class action, a Rule 23 class action or an FLSA collective action that didn't exist at the time, that someone might say was outside the notion of what the -- what Congress could have meant when it said settle a controversy by arbitration."
