The Court reached that conclusion even though pleading guilty waives the vast majority of claims that could be raised on appeal and even though most defendants who plead guilty do not ultimately succeed in their direct appeal. The Court correctly concluded that prejudice is presumed, both because a defendant's disregard for the instruction to notice of an appeal forfeits the entire direct appeal and because the attorney then usurps a fundamental decision that rests with the client alone."

And I wonder how that is consistent with the way Flores-Ortega analyzed the question of whether the attorney was deficient in that situation. If there is such a right, then why wouldn't the attorney have the right to -- have the obligation to consult with the -- with the client and to tell the client that the client has that right?

You rely a lot on the autonomy of the client, and we certainly have a lot of cases saying, you know, a decision whether to appeal or make a major decision like that belong to the client. Here, though, we have a complicating factor that the autonomy's already been expressed through the plea waiver and it's presumptively correct given that it's a final judgment of a trial court at that moment at least. What do we do about that? So autonomy runs both ways here in this particular instance, and presumed prejudice in this circumstance, is there some tension between that and the fact that we don't presume prejudice even when lawyers make really bad, obviously wrong strategic, tactical decisions in cases all the time? How do we reconcile that where even -- even in obvious circumstances we don't presume prejudice? And, here, most of these cases are going to be non-prejudicial, right? So what do we do about those problems?"

We address the specific facts there, which include shortly before his second plea, indicating on a form that he was not waiving his right to appeal; going into two plea hearings, neither of which inquired, as required under state law under Rule 11, into whether he was waiving his right to appeal; and then being advised three times in -- once in the hearing and twice in judgments, that he had a right to appeal. And -- and I just want to note that that claim could not be raised on post-conviction."
