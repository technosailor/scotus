Here, by contrast, there's no doubt and the state openly admits that Morris's allocution was introduced for the truth of the matter asserted, to prove what gun he had at the scene of the crime supposedly. The second way you could distinguish rule of completeness would be that under a theory where if the defendant put in part of an out-of-court statement, for example, here, if Mr. Hemphill had put in part of Morris's allocution, you could think in that context that the defendant has made Mr. Morris, in effect, his witness."

One is even though the Court in Crawford and Giles and other cases has said that the Confrontation Clause codifies the common law right, the state has openly admitted in its brief that it has no historical support for the rule that it's arguing for today. And that -- that -- that's -- that's a big concession given that, for hundreds of years, defendants have gone into court and said, somebody else did it or I wasn't there or I acted in self-defense, as Mr. Crawford himself said, or as Mr. Raleigh said, I didn't participate in this plot, and then the out-of-court statement said, yes, you did. Since the beginning of the criminal law, defendants have defended themselves in ways that out-of-court statements could be introduced to directly contradict their test -- their -- their own defense, and the common law up to the founding and 200-plus years since the founding has always kept those statements out absent an opportunity for cross-examination."

And the last thing I would say, Justice Alito, is even if the way you read the arguments we made to the New York courts is to say, look, we understand that Reid holds as a matter of Sixth Amendment law that a defendant can waive or forfeit his confrontation right simply by presenting evidence that could be contradicted by testimonial hearsay, and we pushed back against Reid in the New York court of appeals without directly and explicitly saying we think Reid is entirely wrong anyways, that would just make this case exactly like two of the Court's recent cases where it found no preservation problem. One is Holmes, where the Court wrote the unanimous opinion, I believe that you authored it, and the state made exactly the same argument that the state is making here, where the first six pages of South Carolina's brief in that case, that what the defendant had done there is simply argue for the misapplication of a prior decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court."

And the other thing in Harris is what the Court said is the truth-seeking process of the courts should not be perverted by allowing the defendant to -- to manipulate evidence and keep out trustworthy evidence.

Furthermore, he did something that pretrial the judge had issued a very strong ruling and had made a determination that a theory of the defense was misleading, and that was to ask the jurors to rely on the fact that the prosecutors were charging him and, therefore, they believed that Morris was guilty. It was asking the jurors really for vouching, and that's how the judge framed it, that's how he talked about it, that the -- the defense was -- wanted to rely on vouching, all right? And so, if you look, for example, in the Joint Appendix at pages, I think, 48 through 56, there's a tremendous discussion in there about what the judge saw was misleading. Counsel's efforts to use the prosecutor's previous opening or beliefs and conclusions of the government actors as though that were factual evidence that should be considered for its truth --"
