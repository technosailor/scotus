If you win on the precise -- on the question on which we granted cert, which is whether there is a total exemption for legislative enactment -- so let's assume for the sake of argument that the Court were to agree with you on that, and so there has to be an application of whatever the test is to legislative enactments. And then there are legislative enactments and there are legislative enactments, and they -- some apply to a very broad category of -- of property, and some apply -- some could apply to a very narrow category of property. And -- and my question is whether you think that the test that applies to a legislative enactment that applies to a category of property should be the same as the one that applies in the permitting process, where there is an individualized determination.

If you win on the idea that legislative exactions are subject to Nollan/Dolan and you win on impact fees are subject to Nollan/Dolan, then it comes down to how do you apply the nexus and rough proportionality test that Justice Kagan, Justice Alito, Justice Gorsuch have been asking you about. And I found your reply brief -- well, first of all, the amicus briefs of the states and of the American Planning Association, for example, say in essence, paraphrasing, it would be a total disaster to try to do that on a parcel-specific basis and would really destroy the concept of imposing impact fees for new development. And in your reply brief, I thought you came back on page 16 and said: \"While a fee based on classes of development can survive Nollan/Dolan, a fee schedule premised on a range of fees for different development classes will not necessarily run afoul of Nollan/Dolan.\" And that -- and I think you've repeated that today. And then you have a sentence: \"Of course, to guarantee the fee is constitutional, the government must make an individualized determination that the fee as applies to his project satisfies Nollan/Dolan.\" So I view those two things as inconsistent in that paragraph, and I'm trying to kind of drill down on what exactly are you saying needs to be shown by a county when it has a fee schedule or formula in order to show rough proportionality?"

I mean, when you're deciding how reticulated it has to be, would the lines drawn between various categories be judged on a rational basis level? Because it seems like you're saying, well, you look at whether the category is roughly proportional, but, as Justice Kavanaugh's pointing out, individual parcels within that category may have varying impacts on the traffic. So how do you decide where the lines should be drawn?"

So it seems to me that there is a threshold assumption that the permit exaction would otherwise trigger the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and the question is, is it exempt from that just because of legislation. So, because there is disagreement about whether it would trigger it to begin with, I would think that to isolate the question presented as -- at a minimum, we would have to expressly preserve the assumption, right? I mean, our -- our holding or our opinion would have to say assuming that a permit exaction of the nature of this one triggers the unconstitutional, that we couldn't not say that, right, in order to just isolate the question presented?"

And so, when the parties go back and -- and parties across this country read this Court's decision, it remains clear that you have to identify a taking for a Nollan/Dolan claim to get off the ground.

The other interesting thing about the court of appeal's decision is that it doesn't treat this exaction as a tax or a user fee or anything else other than a mitigation requirement. So this case comes to the Court on the premise this -- that this is a mitigation requirement and that the only reason the court of appeal thought that Nollan and Dolan don't apply is because of its legislative character. In other words, the courts in California agree with us that at least in some cases, ad hoc impact fees, those are subject to Nollan and Dolan, which I think is an interesting concession from the California courts even that -- that go contrary -- that goes contrary to the county's and the United States Government's position. On the issue of due process, rational -- equal protection, yes, those clauses could be available in a challenge like this, but the problem, of course, is that they provide very little protection to the property owner. Substantive due process, as I understand the cases, would require a showing of arbitrary and capricious on the part of the property owner challenging it."
