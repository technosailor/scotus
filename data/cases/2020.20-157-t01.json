So some -- some communities are creating a situation where social workers go in. Would that be reasonable? Do you need to have an administrative scheme or an administrative warrant or something like that?

But I am concerned deeply about the First Circuit's claim that there is no requirement that officers must select the least intrusive means of fulfilling care -- community caretaking responsibilities. I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some -- some -- whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some -- some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not."
