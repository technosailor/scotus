And the rationale that this Court applied in Martinez for why you weren't at fault for not bringing the claim in the first instance applies squarely to (e)(2) as well.

Blake. Congress sets the rules and courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to, and I think that's the fundamental question, here, Congress through A and B by setting such a high bar for having an evidentiary hearing, even actual in a sense is not enough."

Even in a state where ineffective assistance of trial counsel is brought in direct appeal, if there's one level of post-conviction review and that post-conviction review counsel does not pursue those claims, then, as a matter of independent and adequate state law, the federal court can't hear it. So I don't think Martinez was doing anything more than what it purported to do, which was to narrowly create an equitable basis for cause following a procedural default. As to the waiver on Ramirez, just to be clear, the state's position up to the panel hearing was, even if you look at that evidence, it's not going to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel."
