And -- and so I think really -- and then again to come back, Taylor focus -- focuses on -- it says, look, what the states were trying to do here is focusing on modern law enforcement concerns, right? And the concern, of course, is that there's a trespasser in your house or some other building or other structure like that and that he's intent on committing a crime.

If you walk away from that approach, I think you're left with the difficult questions of what is and what isn't risky in -- in a particular consequence. And the -- the government, I think, has -- has not asked you to revisit Taylor in this case. As to whether this issue is a big deal, I think it is a big deal because the government can just charge entry or remaining and it essentially makes the long-standing traditional rule of intent at entry disappear in all but the very small number of cases that the government identifies, such as a fleeting entry or an interrupted entry. And I -- we don't see any evidence in Taylor that there was intent to make that big a change. If this does become a problem, obviously the Department is well positioned to ask Congress to fix it. And if there are no further questions, we would suggest that a call to simplicity doesn't justify overlooking hundreds of years under which the essence of burglary has been somebody who trespasses for the purpose of committing a crime."
