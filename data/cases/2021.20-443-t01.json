The court of appeals then again usurped the district court's discretion by insisting that the jury had to hear unreliable hearsay accusations against Respondent's brother by a dead man with a powerful motive to lie. We'll never know how or why three drug dealers were killed in Waltham in 2011, and none of Respondent's evolving theories justifies inserting that separate crime into the penalty phase proceedings for Respondent's own individual participation in the 2013 Marathon bombing. And even if the court of appeals had identified a misstep in one of the hundreds of judgment calls that this complex trial required, any error here was harmless."

But the first question, reviewing the supervisory rule, is whether the court of appeals had the power to enact the rule at all, and the second is whether this Court, exercising its own supervisory power, would find that rule reasonable. As to the first question, I think the fundamental problem with this rule is that it divests district courts of discretion that this Court has repeatedly insisted that they have over jury selection. If you look at, for example, page 424 of the Court's decision in Mu'Min against Virginia, the Court emphasizes that not only in constitutional review but also in exercising supervisory power over the federal courts, it has given district courts wide discretion over jury selection because they're there and they can see the jurors as they're individually questioned and are familiar -- also familiar with local conditions. As to the -- the second inquiry, I think the main point here would be that although such questions can be helpful in some cases, they're not invariably helpful, and the district court had sound reasons for thinking that they would be unhelpful here. I'd also note that on the third point I made, Justice Thomas, that the court of appeals, in devising this rule, clearly has a prejudice inquiry built into it."

So I just thought I'd give you a little bit of a hypothetical -- or maybe it's not a hypothetical, maybe it's just asking you to assume something that you contest -- which is assume for me that the evidence was very strong that Tamerlan participated in and indeed had a leading role in the Waltham murders, all right?

And if you look a couple bullet points down on JA 584, you will see that Kadyrbayev also offered to testify that one month before the bombing he had a conversation with Respondent in which Respondent admitted that he'd learned how to make bombs and was speaking glowingly of martyrdom."

And, third, I don't -- that crime is not particularly related to the Boston bombing in which Respondent personally participated and there was substantial evidence about the roles of the brothers in planning that crime. Some of that evidence was disputed, but I think what is quite clear and what we put into the record is that Respondent -- there was evidence that Respondent told a friend he was planning something with Tamerlan, there was evidence that Respondent had sent messages and tweets touting jihad, there was evidence that he bought the gun from his drug dealer, there was evidence he went to a firing range to practice something -- excuse me, I -- I -- I meant to say he told a friend he was doing something with Tamerlan, not necessarily planning something with Tamerlan."

So the Federal Death Penalty Act, the first sentence says the defendant may present any information relevant to a mitigating factor. And that's consistent with our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. But it goes on to say information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury -- jury -- the jury. So I want to know if reliability is the same as that? And just because something would be admitted under the Federal Rules of Evidence as a statement against interest or, I guess put differently, the hearsay rules wouldn't keep it out doesn't mean that the district court wouldn't have discretion under 403, under a very similar standard as this, to keep it out. So I think another way to think about Justice Alito's question is, is this part of the Federal Death Penalty Act inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, or do you think that that sentence in the Federal Death Penalty Act is a legitimate ground for excluding evidence?"

Second, they've -- and as far as admissibility, they've really focused on this indoctrination theory, and I think that is really not especially probative of anything that is mitigating here. I mean, essentially, what they'd be arguing to the jury is, yeah, Tamerlan sent all this jihadist literature, but what really got me into the jihadist literature was learning that what the end of the road in jihad is committing murder, and, moreover, I want to amp that up by committing murder at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. I -- I don't think that is particularly helpful or particularly probative for -- as -- as far as mitigation goes. And I think that dovetails with the third point I want to make here, which is it's in some ways easy to view all this from an appellate remove, which is what we're doing here, but the easiest way to resolve this case is simply on harmless error principles and think about what the jury actually heard. I don't think this comes through as much in the briefs as if the Court takes a little bit of time, it'll only take a little bit of time, to review some of the video evidence that's included in the joint appendix. I particularly recommend Exhibits 22, 23, and 1304C, and what those exhibits show -- I've already gone through some of the evidence about Respondent being involved in the planning of the offense."

So Tamerlan's clearly waiting for a signal from Respondent."

If that's not someone who set off the bomb himself or at least knew exactly when it was going to go off and what its blast radius was going to be, I -- I don't know what is.
