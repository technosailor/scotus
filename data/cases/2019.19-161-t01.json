What we're saying is, on these historical facts, no asylum officer could reasonably have concluded that he did not meet the low significant possibility standard, the very low standard, which is a significant possibility of ultimately satisfying the asylum standard, which in itself is just a one-in-ten chance. And I'm going into the merits now, but the reason we say that we are okay with a standard that says egregious error, clear error, no reasonable adjudicator, because, at that point, you are reaching a legal error, is because the asylum officer, by statute, is required to look at the reports on country conditions. Every report, as the amicus briefs from the asylum experts and the Sri Lanka experts point out, there is an exact M.O. in how Tamil people are persecuted in Sri Lanka."
