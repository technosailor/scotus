Respondents' new contention that some method-of-execution cases sound in habeas is wrong, wrong about the scope of the writ, wrong about the scope of Section 1983, and wrong under this Court's method-of-execution case law. Proposing a non-statutory method of execution is proposing a method of execution. By its very nature, the claim does not attack the validity of the death sentence, which places it squarely on the 1983 side of the line that this Court has demarcated. And that is particularly so because Mr. Nance is required to prove that the state has a feasible and readily available alternative means of carrying out the execution."

And the state has good reasons for doing that. That is not an accident. If changing the method of execution invalidated the sentence and required a new sentence, that could have collateral effects, such as reopening post-conviction review or a retroactivity analysis.

Ultimately, what we have here is a question of federal law because the scope of habeas -- federal habeas and the scope of Section 1983 are federal questions. And we know from the Malloy case, as Justice Sotomayor referred to, that simply going from one punishment to another, at least without more, doesn't present an ex post facto concern. The scope of what state law does, I suppose, could vary in some other state, but as to what Georgia law does, there's no question. And I point the Court to the Dawson case, which we do talk about in our briefs, which -- in which the argument was made, because the state was moving from electrocution to lethal injection, there was a contention actually made by the state, I believe, in that case that resentencing -- that -- that it was a challenge to the death penalty itself. And the Court said no, that is not the case as a matter of Georgia law."

So maybe just to abstract away from that and to give you an example that is not at all realistic for what states actually do, but if a state were to adopt either as a statutory matter or put in its constitution that the method of execution is, say, burning at the stake, and a prisoner who says I agree that the death sentence is valid, my judgment is valid, but I should be -- but burning at the stake super adds pain relative to lethal injection. The fact that the state would then have to take a step and if it wanted to carry out the execution in a constitutional manner amend its law, then that does not change the nature of the claim and does not make it a habeas --"

Just to give one example, when Virginia repealed the death penalty recently, by statute, they changed all of those sentences. They didn't require resentencing or anything like that.

Will he maybe be released? In the capital context, the question should be, well, can he be executed if we rule this way or can the warden no longer execute him? That's the question.

And so we have some discretion, I think, a gray area, and it seems like we've been on a 15-year effort to organize how these method-of-execution claims should proceed, culminating in Bucklew, which gave pretty clear directions about that and also repeated the Hill versus McDonough thing about undue delay and too late. So I guess my question is why would we upset all of that and create new complications, for example, on the second or successive question, as illustrated by Justice Alito's questions earlier, we're going to get into a whole set of complications under that."
