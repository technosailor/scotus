  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Respondents are a class of noncitizens subject to reinstated removal orders, which generally are not open to challenge. However, if a noncitizen has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture in the countries designated in their removal orders, the person may pursue withholding of removal. That is the remedy the respondents in this case sought, and they are being detained by the government while they await the outcome of those withholding-only proceedings.</p>\n<p>The respondents requested individualized bond hearings, which could lead to their release during the withholding-only proceedings. The government argued that they are not entitled to individualized bond hearings because they were subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, and bond hearings were denied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noncitizens argued that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226, rather than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, governs their detention. Section 1226 provides for detention \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States\" and allows for discretionary release on bond.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled in favor of the noncitizens, finding that the text of the two statutes made clear that \u00a7 1226 applied. The court held that \u00a7 1231 does not come into play until the government has \u201cthe present and final legal authority to actually execute that order of removal.\u201d A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n",
