Then, from 1998 to 2017, I think, if I've got it right, the Government took the opposite view, the view of the amicus, that the circuit foreclosure test, neither of those tests work and that the savings clause should be measured about whether it's effective and adequate to raise the argument, that the baseline would be implicit in the text or explicit in the test -- text. And now, for the first time, the Government's coming up with a completely new theory that no circuit courts adopted and neither side in this litigation pursues. What are we supposed to make of that?"

And there's a difference between you on the exact scope of the differences, but I think it's at least true that in habeas you don't have the certificate of appealability and you don't have that pre-filing certification.

One thing it might have been thinking, as Justice Barrett pointed out in her separate writing in Chazen, is perhaps it overlooked this, which is fairly realistic because this language was drafted before Bailey against United States, which was kind of a watershed of a statutory interpretation case that applied to a large number of criminal convictions. It wasn't until a couple years later in Bousley that it was clear how a case like that would shake out retroactively, and even then, Congress was probably thinking about Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims, not pure statutory claims. But, if Congress was thinking about this, I think it might have been thinking a few different things."

And then you've got the point that I was discussing with Justice Jackson, which is that these kinds of claims aren't really the kinds of claims where you care very much whether they go to the sentencing court or not because, as this Court made clear in Bousley and House and Schlup, they involve a lot of extra-record evidence that, you know, under Rule 11, for example, with plea negotiations, the sentencing courts never see. And that in turn would have forced Congress, if it were trying to include these claims under (3) -- under (h), like a new (h)(3), to kind of grapple with some difficult issues and maybe rejigger its structure of habeas, which is kind of unwieldy as it is, even more because, first of all, it's a little hard to get a court of appeals to figure out how to certify that in the 30 days that the 2244 procedures require. And then, when we're talking about the certificate of appealability problem, if we're talking about a first 2255, every Rehaif claimant is going to pair a statutory claim with a Fifth Amendment claim or a Sixth Amendment claim. You can't do that on a successive motion because you're not going -- because those are going to be old constitutional rules."

They -- they're -- they're saying you can bring a second and successive petition if there's newly discovered evidence or if there's a new rule of constitutional law that's made retroactive and therefore would apply to you. Those two kinds of scenarios in which Congress is making very clear that they wanted people to be able to get past the second or successive bar seem to me to be substantively very similar to what is happening here to Mr. Jones.

You said 2255 -- you sort of agreed with Justice Kagan's premise that maybe the savings clause is generally about when is 2255 not working, and you suggested a couple of situations in which that wouldn't be -- when it wouldn't work because the court is not there or because the nature of the relief is such that you couldn't get it or some sort of technical situations like that. What I'm still not so clear on is why 2555 could not be working if, because of one of its provisions, it's, you know, unconstitutional or it doesn't allow you or doesn't allow for actually innocent people to have one clear shot at relief. Like why isn't that a species of 2255 is not working and, therefore, you need to be in the habeas lane?"
