As I mentioned in the last comment, I think we have to understand what the situation was as of 1890, '90, to understand the text of these statutes, but I want to focus on the text, in particular, the text of the statute that abolishes the tribal courts and the text of the statute that creates, in essence, municipal towns within Indian territory during the 1890s and what the significance of those two statutes are for assessing sovereignty, because, ultimately, the question, as Justice Thomas suggested, I think, is what -- what's the status of legislative, executive, and judicial power. How should we think about those statutes with the tribal courts and the municipal towns?"

And that things got very complicated and they came mighty close to ending the reservation but never quite passed the kind of language that we typically see when that happens, reversion of all lands to the public domain or cessation or anything like that.
