I think, to be clear about our position here, we recognize that the federal government has quite broad authority to preempt. Our submission to this Court is simply that the federal government did not do so either in the General Crimes Act or in Public Law 280. And the core of our position is that there is simply nothing in the language of either of those statutes that divests the states of jurisdiction. But, to address your point directly, Justice Sotomayor, the only limit on the federal government's ability to preempt is any limit that might exist at the outer bounds on the federal government's exercise of its enumerated powers in this area. And I think that there may come a point, for instance, on the facts presented in McBratney, if -- if the federal government, say, passed a law that preempted state authority over, you know, non-Indian-on-non-Indian crime, maybe there comes a point at which you start to wonder what the source of enumerated authority is."

First of all, with regard to supposedly foisting this authority on the states, let's keep in mind the fact that the states do enforce the criminal laws already in Indian country by virtue of the rule first established by this Court in McBratney. When non-Indians commit crimes against non-Indians in Indian country, law enforcement is there, state law enforcement is there, because they have exclusive authority in order to enforce the criminal law."

Most of the land is fee land, like the land in downtown Tulsa and the other cities in the eastern half of Oklahoma, and, therefore, would not have been thought of as Indian country. Now I think, with regard to Oklahoma, the history, as you are well aware, is somewhat complicated in this regard, because there was a lengthy period of time when the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, in fact, said that the state had plenary criminal jurisdiction even over Indian country in the state, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals eventually reversed that position. And so I think it's very hard to say that there's a lot of data about what the State of Oklahoma was doing."

So, as to the text, our fundamental submission here is that when you look at the structure of that sentence in Section 1152, it provides simply that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed within federal enclaves shall extend to the Indian country. And I think that, as a matter of structure and plain language, that suggests that what you're talking about is the substantive criminal laws of an area that is within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, federal enclaves."

So I do think that, with respect, we're entitled to point to this Court's precedent, not least because this Court's precedent involves interpretation of the two statutes on which Respondent relies. And with regard to Public Law 280, the one thing that I wanted to say in response to Justice Gorsuch, because that is, after all, the other statute on which the other side relies, is that when you start to frame the argument in terms of Public Law 280 occupying the field and the like, that starts to feel like a field preemption argument. And I think Respondent almost goes there in his brief because he relies on cases like Virginia Uranium and Hines, but he doesn't use the words \"field preemption,\" and I would submit that that's for good reason, because Public Law 280 would fall -- fall short -- far short of the standard for field preemption, not least because, as this Court indicated in Three Affiliated Tribes, there's no indication in Public Law 280 that Congress intended to oust the states of preexisting jurisdiction."

Everyone also agrees before this Court that the only relevant source of federal law is statutes because, Justice Sotomayor, there's no argument here that there's any treaty by its terms that has preemptive effect. And so then the question becomes what is there in the statute that preempts, and there's a statutory interpretation component to that. Now we would say that the first and last place you look is to the text of the statutes, and everyone agrees that there's nothing on the face of the statutes with the exception of this potential argument with regard to the phrase \"sole and exclusive jurisdiction,\" that preempts. And if you don't accept that argument, then what you're left arguing is making arguments based on background understandings, and we really have two of those arguments in this case: an argument with regard to the 1834 predecessor to the General Crimes Act that it embedded the principle of territorial separation from Worcester, or an argument that the 1948 recodification, which after all was just the recodification in the United States Code without substantive change, somehow ratified this Court's interpretation in a single sentence of text in its dicta in Williams at a time when the law was unsettled. That would come nowhere near this Court's standard for ratification, which is why I suspect Respondent doesn't affirmatively invoke that doctrine. And I think, with regard to Worcester and the background understanding, this Court has long retreated, as has Congress, from the hard-line view of territorial separation. And if that were not true, then this Court would have to revisit decisions like McBratney, Draper, and, more recently, Nevada versus Hicks, all of which have given the states broad law enforcement authority in Indian country in the criminal context. And so, with respect, I think what you're really left with on the other side is some sort of mosaic theory."

And to the extent that the other side points to the original understanding, there is no doubt in the early years of our history that there was a problem, a problem with incursions by non-Indians on Indian country and a raft of treaties that conferred authority on the federal government. But what you don't have is evidence that the federal government -- that the treaties were thereby ousting the states of jurisdiction. The problem might very well have been nonenforcement, but there is no reason to believe, either from the treaties nationwide or the treaties specific to Oklahoma, that those treaties by their terms ousted the state of jurisdiction. And to the extent that the treaties refer to the jurisdiction or even the absolute jurisdiction of the United States, I would point the Court to its decision in Draper and its decision in Egan that have made clear that those provisions should not be construed as ousting states of any or all jurisdiction."

And when there are victimless crimes, it has long been the view of the lower courts that where the perpetrator is a non-Indian, the state would have jurisdiction. I think it is fair to say, as the OLC opinions from the 1970s made clear, that the line between crimes with a victim and victimless crimes is itself a fuzzy one."

And that, I think, is profoundly contrary to the -- the bargain, the agreement that Indian tribes made with the United States where the United States said we are going to be your protector and make sure that you are taken care of. Now it is true that as a formal matter, as the law stands today, you can have, you know, concurrent federal prosecutions, but, as a practical matter, the entire upshot of my friend on the other side's position is that the federal government can go back and wash its hands of these sorts of offenses and, you know, not invest the resources. And, you know, our fundamental position is that the federal government actually has an obligation to invest those resources to make sure this is being done right unless and until either Congress passes a statute or tribal citizens decide under Public Law 280 that they would like a different system to help protect themselves from crime."

Number one, in 1834, Congress's backdrop was Worcester, so that was the understanding that Congress had when it enacted the, you know, forerunner to the General Crimes Act. Second, you know, those same cases like Williams versus Lee that say we have departed in some respects from Worcester emphasized that the rule in this case is that state courts lack jurisdiction. And, third, I don't think we have to guess about sort of how to translate, you know, Worcester into, you know, an era where you have reservations existing within state boundaries because we have everything that happened in 1940, 1948, and thereafter, where you see Congress itself grappling with what should be the rule against the backdrop of this Court's cases saying, you know, we have recognized this one ground for state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country and it doesn't apply to crimes by or against Indians. So I think the core point is that as the -- as to the question presented here, you know, this is something that Congress really has resolved."

The Major Crimes Act is phrased differently, so it doesn't use this language of \"extend.\" It says an Indian who commits certain crimes against another Indian \"shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\" Well, a person who commits any of those offenses within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States is subject to only one law, and it's the law of the United States."

For over 100 years, starting with this Court's decision in Donnelly, the Court has construed Section 1152 in exactly that manner. And beginning more than 80 years ago, Congress has repeatedly enacted laws that made clear that an act of Congress is necessary to authorize a state to authorize -- to conduct such prosecutions. The roots of exclusive federal jurisdiction under the statute, in fact, go much deeper, though, to the founding, when the framers rejected the divided authority under the Articles of Confederation and invested plenary and exclusive power over Indian affairs in the national government. And the early Congresses invoked those powers by enacting Section 1152's predecessors to prevent violence that could lead to war and to further the nation's commitments to protect the Indians and their -- the Indians and their territories from federal encroachment -- encroachment by often hostile states and their citizens. This Court should reject the proposition that it should overturn 100 years of settled understanding of this statute in this Court and Congress, by the executive branch, and in the states to solve a problem following this Court's decision in McGirt because the result would be to unsettle established jurisdictional understandings and jurisdictional arrangements in many other states and, in fact, would unsettle jurisdictional understandings in the State of Oklahoma beyond what was -- that were in existence at the time of the decision in McGirt. Oklahoma has much trust and restricted allotment land in both the western part of the state and the eastern part of the state, which for more than 30 years has been understood to be subject to exclusive jurisdiction, and the states have not been able to apply their laws there. So what the state is asking for here is not just to go back to what the situation was before McGirt but to undo the settled understanding in Oklahoma itself about the -- the application of state law to --"

And to the extent that finding no footing in the text of the General Crimes Act, my friends turn to the Major Crimes Act, we think that the proper way to construe the Major Crimes Act is as indicating that an Indian who commits a crime -- a crime that is enumerated is subject to prosecution within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, not simply that such an individual is subjected to the same punishment as an individual who commits a crime within federal enclaves. This Court's decisions in John and Negonsott relied on the text of the statute, albeit without much explanation, and that's even clearer when you look at the earlier versions of the two statutes, which we cite in our reply brief.
