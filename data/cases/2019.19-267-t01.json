But then, if you -- if you -- let's say you have something where the church is -- or the religious defendant is raising some other thing as an important religious function, then I think you probably -- you -- you would -- you would have to look -- do some deference to the church's understanding of that.

That's my first question. My second question is, I think what's being confused here is that you're asking for an exception to law that's broader than the ministerial exception generally and broader than is necessary to protect the church. The two teachers at issue here are not claiming that they were fired because the school thought they were teaching religion wrong."

What it did decide was that employment discrimination claims that involve the hiring or firing of an employee necessarily go to a religious organization's ability to control who ministers to the faithful and that those claims are categorically precluded. So we would apply the same rule here. And then the question is just what's the appropriate methodology for determining that a person is one who ministers to the faithful."

Here, however, it seems to me, instead of pursuing that line of argument and suggesting that the sincerely held religious belief about who is a minister should control, you're asking this Court to involve itself in deciding for itself who is and who is not an important minister or just a de minimis, I think is the words you've -- you've used, person in -- in the teaching of religion. Doesn't that create just exactly the sort of entanglement problems that we've tried to avoid elsewhere and discriminate potentially against minority religions that may have different views of ministers than -- than you or I may have? And you -- you -- you reject all these hypotheticals as speculative or haven't yet arisen, but the very test you propose would seem to me to invite them."

So I think I want to focus on a narrower argument in this case that I hear the schools and the government making, which is that these particular teachers should be considered ministers, even though they did not have to be Catholic to have their job, simply because their job included teaching religion. And our position is the Court should reject this contention for three reasons. First, the school's argument would strip more than 300,000 lay teachers in religious schools across the country of basic employment law protections, and necessarily included in this number are teachers who teach so-called secular classes. This has been a focus of a lot of questioning this morning, so I want to emphasize this."

Imagine the English teacher who teaches rhetoric using the Sermon on the Mount or the history teacher who during Passover describes the exodus from Egypt or who explores divine will through Lincoln's second inaugural address or the science teacher who teaches creationism or intelligent design. I don't really understand what the other side means when they talk about de minimis teaching of religion or outlier, I think was the word Ms. Ratner used."

And so that's this case, I think, Justice Ginsburg, as you have said, with Ms. Biel and her cancer treatments and with Morrissey-Berru being fired simply because, she alleges, she got too old, is that those are the cases where the ministerial exception matters. And maybe this is the way I would say, stripped of all the labels, I think, which can make the case sound more complicated than it is, I think the best way to think about this case is to say when does a church require or, sorry, I should say a religious employer require absolute categorical immunity to hire and fire people for whatever reason they want, whether it be race discrimination, whether it be any -- any other thing that doesn't have anything to do with their religion, and when, on the other hand, is it enough, with respect to an employee, to say, of course, you have an important stake in how they perform their religious functions and duties, and if you have a problem with that, you're allowed to fire them or discipline them or anything else, but you can't -- you just simply can't do it for non-religious reasons? And our submission here, just to -- just to finish that thought, is we think when it comes to lay teachers, the 300,000 lay teachers in Catholic schools and other religious schools across the country, not to mention the 1- or 200,000 more teachers in religious universities and colleges, that we think when you talk about those people, it is enough to serve the religions' legitimate interest to say if you have a problem with how they're teaching religion or how they're otherwise upholding themselves in light of your faith, you can hire or fire them."

So I can not only give you my theory today, but I can lend you the practical assurance that for several decades in the lower courts -- and this all -- these are all gathered in Footnote 1 of our red brief -- the courts consistently held that lay teachers in religious schools, even if they taught some religion, were outside the ministerial exception. And so that line was durable and workable, and, indeed, the federal government brought many of those cases and established that rule and had that rule across several administrations for many decades. So it's a little bit like the Maui case, Justice Breyer, where you have hard lines to draw, but you can take some comfort with decades of experience in lower courts and the government's own position that prevailed until the moment of this case right now. So I think that actually should help bolster my position just in practical terms because, if you write an opinion that says all important religious functions trigger the ministerial exception, I don't think there's just any way to escape you're going to have the cases with the nurses, you're going to have the cases with the football coaches, you're going to have the cases with the summer counselors. The only thing the other side says to that in our brief is, well, those cases haven't been brought so much."

And remember, Justice Alito, I don't think there's any possible way to distinguish the general curriculum teacher who teaches religion 40 minutes a day from the science teacher, the history teacher, the English teacher, who probably, once you tally up the number of minutes in that day where religion comes into play, is teaching at least 40 minutes worth of religion if not anything more.

So it really is a sea change -- even as to teachers, leaving everything else aside, it is truly a sea change that is being requested by the other side here today in terms of how teachers in schools are classified and whether they have any employment rights at all or -- or, in fact, whether at least if you follow the way the lower courts have -- have implemented the ministerial exception, you basically have employment law-free zones in all religious schools."

With respect to a teacher who is a full-time teacher of religion, teaching religious doctrine, teaching religious practice, teaching religious texts, any of those things, I would have thought that Hosanna-Tabor, even though it has the thing about commissioning and title and so forth, you know, thinks of those people whose job it is to teach religion and to basically bring up the next generation in important understandings of religious doctrine and practice, that those people would be covered. But you said no, and so I wanted to just sort of say why?"

And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh, if I would just return you -- I know I've said this before, but the cases we cite in red brief -- in our red brief in Footnote 1 deal with schools of the Christian faith, of Jewish faith, and I think even some other faiths.
