So I don't think all the further -- the more recent references to hot pursuit or to Santana could create a rule that didn't otherwise exist. And so then the question is, what do we think of -- what -- what is the holding of Santana? And Santana itself says that it was \"clearly governed by Hayden.\" And Hayden, again, the parties all agree, was not even a hot pursuit case and it -- and it involved exigent circumstances. And so Santana, we think, certainly has cross-currents in the paragraph of analysis that the parties have debated, but just like in Share, this Court dealt with more recently in Collins, we think in that situation it's best read as a fact-bound exigent circumstances opinion."

So, on page 14 of your brief, you refer -- summarize existing doctrine with respect to destruction of evidence, the risk of persons who are threatened with serious injury, to protect the officers or the public, and then you also say -- and this is the one I really want to explore -- to prevent a suspect's escape. And wouldn't the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine in all those things apply almost inevitably in a hot pursuit case, particularly preventing a suspect's escape, because the suspect has already escaped, in essence, from -- or fled from the officer, and so, to use your phrase, there is reason to believe -- I think that was your phrase to the Chief Justice -- there's reason to believe that the suspect will escape from the house because they've already fled?"

How can I -- how can we ignore that teaching of the common law? And I guess I go back to Justice Gorsuch's point that perhaps we should just hew to the common law more strictly and recognize exceptions only that reflect the teachings of the common law, so exigent circumstances, hot pursuit for serious offenses that themselves, like the Solicitor General suggests, suggest a basis for entry or a need for entry. Why don't we just adopt the exception without reference to labels like felony or misdemeanor but go back to whether or not the protection was necessary and the crime reflected the issues that the common law thought important to justify warrantless entry?"

I guess that cuts both ways, though, because one could say, well, you don't need a categorical rule because you already have the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine that covers all the things that justify the categorical rule. So I guess I'm wondering what the real difference in practice would be between a world where we have a categorical rule and a world where we allow all the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine cases to apply as they exist now."

Why do we take -- and as we've pointed out again and again and again, today, the line between felonies and misdemeanors can seem quite arbitrary -- so why would we pull out as the key fact something's designation as a felony? Why wouldn't we simply say, okay, for the very serious crimes that used to be felonies at common law, then this rule applies, but otherwise the felony/misdemeanor line doesn't really have much significance here? In other words, why is it felony rather than the list of particular crimes that justify warrantless entry into the home?"

Does the suspect have to be aware of it or reasonably perceived to be aware of it? Does the officer have to witness the crime? There could be any number of other case-specific questions on which circuit splits could already be seen to be proliferating in the lower courts about what constitutes hot pursuit. So we think the best solution here is to recognize in general terms that hot pursuit, as Justice Kavanaugh puts it, is important for exigent circumstances but not draw firm bright lines about a category of hot pursuit. And then, finally, you have the question of administrability."
