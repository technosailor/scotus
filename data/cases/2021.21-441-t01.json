                "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over the past 35 years, quarterly fees paid by Chapter 11 debtors have sometimes differed across districts, but those differences did not violate the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause, as illustrated by the wide variations in fees that were permitted under the first two bankruptcy acts enacted by Congress in 1800 and 1841. Such fees are either not subject to the uniformity requirement or their variation comports with what this Court has called the flexibility inherent in the constitutional provision. In any event, Congress acted to avoid any potential non-uniformity in 2000 by adopting the recommendation of the Judicial Conference to allow the six bankruptcy administrator districts to charge quarterly fees \"equal to those imposed\" in the 88 U.S. Trustee districts. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, in 2001, the Judicial Conference adopted a standing order directing payment of the quarterly fees in the statutory amounts \"as those amounts may be amended from time to time.\" When Congress amended those amounts in 2017, the failure of the bankruptcy administrator districts to implement them in time did not violate the uniformity requirement enclosed on -- imposed on Congress, which asked for equal, not unequal fees. But even if Congress had not requested equal fees, Congress was entitled to respond to a shortfall of funding in the U.S. Trustee program by adopting a trustee-specific solution, and even if there were a constitutional violation because of different fees, the appropriate outcome would not be refunding the increased fees that Congress had required for the districts that accounted for 97 percent of the Chapter 11 filings but an invalidation of the narrow exception for the bankruptcy administrator districts, which Congress has already enacted. That's consistent with this Court's cases about federal remedies in this context. I welcome the Court's questions."

My friend suggests that -- that the Court, in looking at the exemptions for the dual system, the Court should take into account the sort of shadow lawmaking that goes on behind the scenes of what states asked for exemptions from the -- from the program and which states didn't.
