I think when this Court has mentioned flagrancy in cases, not only those cases listing the Brown factors, but also classes like Leon and Herring, what it has been concerned about in part is the notion that once you establish an attenuation principle, what I would say is a common-sense principle here that generally an arrest warrant should be a superseding cause of the discovery of the evidence, you might have an officer exploiting though rule precisely in order to get evidence in searches incident to arrests. So I think the way you could think about flagrancy is: Did this officer have the purpose -- and it could be -- either be a purpose objectively understood from all of the facts or it could be a subjective purpose -- to exploit this attenuation exception precisely in order to search incident to arrest.
