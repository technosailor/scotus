You know, you owe a duty to the public at 8:00 that morning when you're a public official, and if you go out of office, you're breaching your duty of honest services because you're doing it to the end of circumventing the prohibition on sale of honest services, and, you know, by extension here, there was no fiduciary duty owed because, as you would say, those facts are not present."

While functioning as a government official and after he had decided to return to formal government employment, Petitioner accepted multiple bribes in exchange for commanding a government agency to reverse a final decision. The relevant agreement occurred after August 6, which was the time that Petitioner indicated that he was returning to government. That was a violation of his duty of honest services as this Court has always understood that duty. I welcome the Court's questions."

And then the final thing I would say -- and this, I think, is probably the most important -- counsel said that when Congress enacted Section 1346 it was trying to reinstate the pre-McNally case law. But, of course, Skilling said that if you read it that way, then it creates a vagueness problem because the pre-McNally case law was inconsistent on numerous points, and, you know, Justice Scalia said it was in chaos. I mean, there was a lot of confusion about what the pre-McNally case law did. And so what Skilling said was, in order to avoid that problem, we've got to read the statute as limited to its core, which it defined as bribery and kickbacks, and then said, in order to figure out what bribery and kickbacks are, we can look at the statutes that we have on the books that define those, specifically, Section 666 and Section 201. But the government can't point to a single case under either 666 or 201 that gets anywhere close to the theory that they are proposing here."

And then it said that in that particular case, when one examines the structure of the program and sees that the act vests in local administrators like petitioners the power to allocate federal fiscal resources and so on, it's clear that they are public officials. I mean, that's not what we have here. And so, because the government can't point to anything in the pre-McNally case law that remotely resembles a consensus, they can't point to anything under 666, and their best example under 201 doesn't get them close, I don't think the conviction can withstand scrutiny. If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honors."
