First, as the United States admits in this case, the criminal complaint was filed while Mr. Thompson -- while the Petitioner was still in custody, and so process, legal process, was initiated, and Petitioner was -- we will have to show Petitioner -- you know, if Respondent is allowed to raise it at this late stage, the Petitioner's seizure -- for the purposes of -- of -- of this particular seizure, we'll have to show that Petitioner's seizure was caused by the initiation of legal process, meaning he would have been released had that false criminal complaint not been filed. The second seizure in this case, which has also been unchallenged since it was specifically ruled upon at the summary judgment stage and deemed proven at trial, you know, we heard nothing from Respondent on this seizure either, is that the -- there's Second Circuit precedent clearly holding that the restrictions when being released on recognizance and the compelled attendance in court hearings constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. You know, our position in this case, though, and I think what's critical for this Court to know is that the Second Circuit is perfectly capable of resolving those kind of late-breaking arguments that Respondent is making before this Court on remand."

The Court, I think, would come to the different conclusion in the context of reading malice into Section 1983 because the Fourth Amendment itself says reasonable, objective inquiry."

Because Petitioner's Section 1983 claim, like a malicious prosecution claim, though not exactly a malicious prosecution claim, challenges the validity of a criminal proceeding against him, incorporating a favorable termination element would well serve those purposes, and in the government's view, the court of appeals was right to require Petitioner to show that the criminal proceeding against him terminated in his favor. The Court erred, however, in requiring that that termination itself indicate innocence. That additional requirement finds virtually no support in the common law of 1871."
