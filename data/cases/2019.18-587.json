  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) adopted a program\u2014known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\u2014to postpone the deportation of undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children and to assign them work permits allowing them to obtain social security numbers, pay taxes, and become part of \u201cmainstream\u201d society in the United States.</p>\n<p>In 2017, after the national election, when the Trump administration replaced the Obama administration, DHS began a phase-out of DACA. The parties do not dispute the authority of a new administration to replace old policies with new policies, but the plaintiffs in this and related challenges allege that the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather than in compliance with the law. Specifically, the Trump administration terminated DACA based on a conclusion that the Obama administration had created DACA \u201cwithout proper statutory authority and with no established end-date\u201d and thus that it was an \u201cunconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in this case and the related cases challenged this conclusion of law, alleging that the recission of DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious, and because it was a substantive rule that did not comply with the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment requirements. The challengers also alleged that the recission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally protected liberty and property interests without due process of law and violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the DACA recission was not \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d and that there was \u201claw to apply.\u201d Further, the Ninth Circuit granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction restoring DACA, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of their arguments, they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the balance of equities tips in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and the injunction is in the public interest.</p>\n",
