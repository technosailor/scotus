That the amount of money is nominal is immaterial to whether an Article III case or controversy exists. Recognizing that the deprivation of a personal right is generally not harmless, common law courts have long awarded nominal damages as partial redress, and Congress incorporated that practice in Section 1983.

And if no other damage is established, the party injured is entitled to a verdict for nominal damages. That is essentially a recognition of a form of liquidated compensatory harm of at least a dollar because the violation of a right isn't harmless, and if it's not harmless, it's entitled to at least a dollar. He then went on to say, a fortiori, if there's a risk of future harm, that would support nominal damages."

But we very clearly have stated that punitive damage -- damages are not to compensate the injured party but, rather, to punish the tortfeasor and deter him and others from similar extreme conduct. If a case has been mooted because an act is not capable of repetition, there's no need to impose punitive damages, no matter how reprehensible the conduct may be. So I don't know how you can concede that punitive damages give you standing under your theory of the case."

Punitive damages, although their purpose is to deter and to punish, they can -- they -- they don't have that sort of legal roadblock that prevents them from being any kind of relief for past harms. And, in fact, Professor Dobbs and -- and other remedy scholars explain that they do provide some incidental compensation, although the law authorizes them for other purposes. And I think one -- one example from this Court's cases, Steel Company, notes that the civil penalties that were awarded in that case, if they were awarded to the plaintiff, even though they were punitive, would provide a sort of compensation or redress to the plaintiff themselves, even though that's not their purpose."
