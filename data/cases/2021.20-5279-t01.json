And even on the government's test and certainly under the test applied by the courts of appeals, you're going to need to know things like what day, what time of day, who was involved, how did the crime unfold, was it in the same place or different places. And, you know, our amici, I think, do a good job pointing out why this is in serious tension at -- at a minimum with the Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. We don't have a Sixth Amendment claim. And because Mr. Wooden's case is so clearly outside the scope of the statute, I would respectfully suggest that it's not necessary for the Court to get into that."

I do think, again, that, you know, our approach has those benefits of administrability where I -- as I do think Petitioner's approach, you know, even if you get past what I think are the textual problems with it and the contextual problems with it, meaning that the ACCA is obviously a statute in which Congress did not want judges sort of sifting through a voluminous state court trial record trying to figure out exactly how a crime happened, much less the surrounding circumstances --"

Without having to really go into, you know, what that tells you is that the elements were committed at different times and what that tells you is that they were all different acts that satisfied those elements. So I think we have sort of provided more theory as to why that common-sense intuition as to one is over before the next began makes sense, but, no, I mean, they haven't exactly mapped it on to the elements in the same way that we would.

Second, even if you had perfect information, you're going to then have to look at it at this granular level that, again, in the ACCA context, for many of the reasons various justices have raised this morning, we don't permit. And third, even then, I do think you're going to have these very difficult line-drawing questions between, you know, the smoke break or the 10, 10:15, 10:55 robberies as opposed to what Mr. Wooden was convicted of doing here. I think what the law ultimately is asking about in the ACCA is were you held criminally responsible for discrete acts, and that is the case here."

First of all, Justice Kagan, I think the reason that you and I both read the government's brief as saying the question is whether the final element was satisfied at the same moment comes from sentences like this on page 15 of the government's brief: \"In common legal parlance, an offense is generally committed when all elements of the offense are established, regardless of whether the defendant continues to engage in criminal conduct.\" There were a number of such sentences, all of which seemed to point to the final element. The question -- a -- a test described as an essential elements test raises for me a number of questions."
