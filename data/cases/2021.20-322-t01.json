With respect to the additional question, the courts below could not enter class-wide injunctive relief because, in Section 1252(f)(1), Congress has expressly limited the lower courts' jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain provisions of the INA, including those governing post-order custody. That limitation applies regardless of the nature of the action or claim, so it is not limited to constitutional challenges, and any such limit would only encourage plaintiffs to do what happened here, seek to avoid the bar by advancing implausible statutory constructions under the guise of constitutional avoidance. Moreover, the statute's exception for orders granting relief to an individual alien against whom removal proceedings have been initiated does not permit class-wide relief simply because every current or future member of a class could have qualified for individual relief. That would be inconsistent with Congress's concern about allowing lower courts to remake the immigration system under readings that have not been adopted by this Court."

And the other thing that I would say about the -- the idea that a class that includes only individual aliens against whom proceedings have already been initiated should come within the exception, the reason why we think that doesn't make sense is not just because it -- it -- it makes \"an individual alien\" superfluous but because these classes in this case, they're constantly being refreshed by new members who satisfy the definition of the class, they come into the class, they get a bond hearing, they go out.

And, indeed, the regulations themself assert -- under 241.4(d)(1), under the custody determination, states that even though an individual must demonstrate they are not a flight risk or a danger to the community in order to be released, that the agency retains the discretion to continue their detention, illustrating amply that their detention is no longer tethered to its lawful purpose. In Zadvydas, both the majority and the dissent clearly agreed that the purpose of the statute was to prevent risk of flight or danger. And just as this Court found that it is arbitrary to detain someone who may no longer be removed, it is equally arbitrary and unlawful to detain someone who does not present a flight risk or a danger to the community. And because of this, it is clear that the government's interpretation fails to satisfy basic constitutional concerns. And because it raises those constitutional concerns and because the text of the statute, this Court's construction in Zadvydas, and the agency's own implementing regulations demonstrate that the court of appeals' construction is more than fairly possible, that construction should be affirmed. The lower courts had the authority and the responsibility under Zadvydas to make those independent determinations at the point the individuals before them, the class members' detention became prolonged. And that does not mean they're going to get out at six months."

And as this Court has repeatedly affirmed, unless there are clear words to the contrary or words that provide the necessary and inescapable inference, as this Court said in Mitchell, it will not interpret a statute to infringe or to limit its equitable authority. And yet that is what the government is asking this Court to do, to broadly read 1252(f)(1) to limit this Court's equitable authority even though the neighboring subsections, in contrasting the language, demonstrate that Congress was not targeting class actions and that it was only targeting challenges that would impede the operation, that is, attack the statute itself, as opposed to those statutes -- those challenges against the policies and procedures that the Attorney General implemented to -- purportedly, to fulfill the scope of the statute."
