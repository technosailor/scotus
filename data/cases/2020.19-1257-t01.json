And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this."

Oftentimes there are -- there are no discriminatory statements available, and yet the Court has -- has said that the way to determine whether racial discrimination is at work as a motivating factor is to analyze the Arlington Heights factors because often, in this day and age, the circumstantial evidence of that is all that's available.
