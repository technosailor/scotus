But second, we read the court of appeals' opinion to have held that the relevant article of manufacture for which profits are owed is always the entire product that the infringer sells to customers. And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all parties to agree with that now. Instead, the relevant article of manufacture to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes be a part or a component of a larger product sold in commerce.",

Once the fact-finder makes that judgment, that's the test that we proposed, and that's, I think, I took to be Justice Sotomayor's question. I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on the car, how do they separate out the part of the profits that are attributable to that component from the whole. And as to that question, we haven't briefed it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that courts have confronted in other areas of law.",

The second question is quantum of profits. And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying that a lot of the expert determinations about how much did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into play, as the government said and we agree, only at the second question: What is the quantum of profits from the right article of manufacture? But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar are we to the government's test? And, Justice Kennedy, you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency among juries. We think the answer to the first question can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus mainly on two factors: What does the design in the patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the front face? And second, what is the product to which it has been applied? That will help judges to guide juries. We think we should have had instruction 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary judgment that the article of manufacture is the front face, and that could be instructed to the jury.",
