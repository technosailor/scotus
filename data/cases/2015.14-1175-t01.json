Hall, I'd like to start, if I might, by setting out what I think are the two main reasons why Nevada v. Hall shouldn't be overruled. First of all, the Court in Nevada v. Hall, unlike the Board in its argument, took account of the fact that, after the formation of the Union, the States retained a great deal of their essential sovereign attributes, and that it was fundamentally inconsistent with those sovereign attributes for another State to declare itself immune as of right from its jurisdiction. The second reason is that the Board has failed to show that the ordinary political processes -- in particular an agreement among the 46 States, which are now represented before the Court, saying they all agree there should be absolute immunity in each other's courts -- why they can't reach that agreement and -- and have that effectively be the law going forward without the intervention of this Court and without the need for this Court --",
