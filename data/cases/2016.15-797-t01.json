And what I didn't get to was, and very importantly, is the Eighth Amendment principles and concerns that this Court outlined in Hall and in Atkins, and the absolute requirement to ensure that somebody who is intellectually disabled is not going to be executed. Third, one point about Chief Justice's initial question that I never quite got to about the question presented, in addition to the fact that, as we did discuss, its interwoven with the Briseno decision. In the cert papers themselves, in our cert petition and our reply, we repeatedly used the phrases like \"nonclinical,\" \"unscientific,\" \"standards completely untethered to clinical consensus.\" And, indeed, the State, in its opposition to the cert petition, rested heavily on the Briseno factors.",
