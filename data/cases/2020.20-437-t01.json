The first is a motion to reopen asking for equitable tolling because, presumably, at that point, the 90-day statutory limit on the motion to reopen would have elapsed. The second is to ask the government to join in a motion to reopen, which would excuse the time bar and would not require the government to actually agree on the merits but would be a mechanism of getting the issue in front of the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals. And the third, and this is the one that changed in 2020, is to ask the immigration judge to rely on his sua sponte authority, and that too would make inapplicable the time bar. Now, in that situation, that's where the regulations changed in 2020, but they were replaced with a provision that would allow an individual to file one untimely motion to reopen when there is a case of a change in law, as well as due diligence on the part of the applicant. So, for all of those reasons, I think Respondent plainly could have sought that type of relief."
