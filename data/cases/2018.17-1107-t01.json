And the Dawes Commission goes and it actually tries to get the Indians to cede the land and says we want cession, cession is easier, cession is -- is better, from the U.S. Government's point of view, and for whatever reason, they think that they need tribal consent and the tribes aren't giving that consent, and so the Commission comes back and they say: No, we're not going to get cession.
