And so that he's basically, I think, he'll speak for himself, obviously, but assuming his argument in my question, that you need to put the district court on some sort of notice what the basis is for you believing that 10 or 12 or 11 months is the right number, and that if you don't do that, then you do need to -- you haven't preserved your objection adequately.

Well, if that's not true -- if that's true, I guess it's hard for me to see why a party shouldn't also object if they disagree with some of the reasoning the district court gave and that reasoning hadn't been discussed previously in sentencing. In that circumstance, it would seem to serve the purposes of Rule 51 to have a rule that asks the parties to apprise the court of -- of the -- that the court has used reasoning or rationales that the parties disagree with, that it believes are incorrect, that it believes are impermissible and have the court -- have the parties engage with the court on that to give the district court an opportunity to address that in the first instance, such that the court of appeals aren't having to address it for the first time on appeal.
