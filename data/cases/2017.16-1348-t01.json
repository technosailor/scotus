So my friend from Virginia, in particular with just -- in a colloquy with Justice Kagan, says the only way issue preclusion works is that you invoke it at the outset of the second trial and, if you cannot bar the second trial at that point, it drops away and the right is gone. And if that is correct, then Judge -- then Judge Gorsuch's opinion for the Tenth Circuit in Wittig and all other eight circuits we cite in Footnote 2 of our reply brief across the federal court system that all understand issue preclusion to depend on what happens in the second trial and to only bar a particular way of trying the case. And most importantly, as Judge Gorsuch put it for the Tenth Circuit, to sometimes force courts to wait and see what happens in that trial to see whether issue preclusion is violated, all of that has to be wrong and it would all be upended."}]}, {"start": 3369.88, "stop": 3376.08, "byte_start": 13509375, "byte_stop": 13534139, "speaker": {"ID": 15068, "name": "Samuel A.
