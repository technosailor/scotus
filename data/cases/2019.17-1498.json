  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>This case arises from Montana\u2019s Anaconda Smelter site\u2014the location of a large copper concentrating and smelting operation that started in 1884 and expanded to other nearby areas in 1902. In 1977, Atlantic Richfield purchased Anaconda Smelter, and it shut down smelter activities in 1980. The smelter operations over the almost-century of operations caused high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc to contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water. In 1983, the EPA prioritized the Anaconda Smelter site as a Superfund site, working with Atlantic Richfield to address the contamination. Since then, Atlantic Richfield has worked with the EPA for 35 years to remediate the site, at a cost of approximately $470 million.</p>\n<p>In 2008, landowners within the Anaconda Superfund site sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state court, alleging that the smelter operations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their properties. Atlantic Richfield raised no objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of loss of use and enjoyment of property, diminution of value, incidental and consequential damages, and annoyance and discomfort. However, it did object to the common-law claim for \u201crestoration\u201d damages.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim for restoration damages in Montana, plaintiffs must prove that they will actually use the award to clean up the site. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires \u201cwork in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy.\u201d Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a \u201cchallenge\u201d to the EPA\u2019s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA \u00a7 113, which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPA-selected remedies. Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d and thus must seek EPA approval under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action. Finally, Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA preempted state common-law claims for restoration.</p>\n<p>The trial court held that CERCLA permitted plaintiffs\u2019 claim for restoration damages, and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the Montana Supreme Court, which the court granted. Over a dissent, the Supreme Court of Montana rejected all three of Atlantic Richfield\u2019s arguments, affirming the trial court\u2019s decision permitting the plaintiffs to proceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim.</p>\n",
  "question": "<ol><li>Is a common-law claim for restoration seeking cleanup remedies that conflict with remedies the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered a jurisdictionally barred \u201cchallenge\u201d to the EPA\u2019s cleanup under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)?</li>\n<li>Is a landowner at a Superfund site a \u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d that must seek EPA approval under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action?</li>\n<li>Does CERCLA preempt state common-law claims for restoration that seek cleanup remedies that conflict with EPA-ordered remedies?</li>\n</ol>",
