  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In June 2014, Louisiana passed Act 620, which required \u201cthat every physician who performs or induces an abortion shall \u2018have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Several abortion clinics and doctors challenged Act 620, and while that challenge was pending in the district court, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a \u201cnearly identical\u201d Texas law in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-274\"><em>Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt</em> (<em>WWH</em>)</a>, finding that the Texas law imposed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion while bringing about no \u201chealth-related benefit\u201d and serving no \u201crelevant credentialing function.\u201d The district court hearing the challenge to Act 620 accordingly declared Act 620 facially invalid and permanently enjoined its enforcement.</p>\n<p>The district court made detailed findings of fact and determined that \u201cadmitting privileges also do not serve \u2018any relevant credentialing function,\u2019\u201d and that \u201cphysicians are sometimes denied privileges \u2026 for reasons unrelated to [medical] competency.\u201d The district court further determined that the law would \u201cdrastically burden women\u2019s right to choose abortions.\u201d</p>\n<p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the panel majority reviewed the evidence de novo and concluded that the district court erred by overlooking \u201cremarkabl[e] differen[ces]\u201d between the facts in this case and in <em>WWH</em>. The panel concluded that \u201cno clinics will likely be forced to close on account of the Act,\u201d and thus, the law would not impose an undue burden on women\u2019s right to choose abortions. A divided Fifth Circuit denied the petition for a rehearing en banc.</p>\n",
