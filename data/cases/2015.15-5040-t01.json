There are many instances where judges or justices worked on an issue, spearheaded an issue, fought for legislation, for example, for years and years and years, even may have had it named after them, and then sat in judgment on the constitutionality or scope of that legislation. Now, I think that the public would see at least as much potential for bias in a situation like that, at least as much possibility that the -- that given human psychology, a justice in that position would be reluctant to overturn his or her own statute. The reason that that's not a constitutional violation is because I think that Caperton, and this Court's law generally, recognize that judges are human beings, they have prior lives, and that we don't want to have a situation where the only people who can become judges and sit on cases are people with no prior experiences.",

Now, under Petitioner's approach, I think that's seriously problematic, a difficulty for the Court. You have two options: Either to continue that practice, having held, if you adopt Petitioner's point of view, that the failure to recuse, the erroneous failure to recuse, taints the votes of every other justice on the Court, but the Court declines to look at the issue; or you adopt a new practice in which the Court, in fact, looks at the recusal of -- the individual recusal and makes a decision for itself, which puts it in the position of deciding who the members of the Court will be on any particular case.",
