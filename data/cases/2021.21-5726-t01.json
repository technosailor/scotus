There's also to some extent the concern that Justice Sotomayor was identifying about instances in which a decision is correct as a -- as a matter of law when it's entered, and then some subsequent decision comes along from a higher court and results in a -- a change in the law that we don't think is appropriate in that circumstance to say that the original decision was a mistake, the district court did exactly what it was supposed to.

And so this Court has said time and again that when there is binding precedent of a higher court, the lower courts are required to apply that precedent unless and until it's overturned.
