Even the Ninth Circuit appeared to recognize the force of that point, and it did not suggest that Respondents could have had the discovery they seek here from the CIA itself. Instead -- and this was the Court's second error -- it held that two former contractors can be compelled to confirm or deny the existence of the facility under oath because they are not agents of the United States.

They made that request in the district court too, and the district court rejected it -- this is at page 56A of the petition appendix -- and explained that because this entire proceeding is predicated on assisting an investigation in Poland by a Polish prosecutor, it would be disingenuous to try to pretend that it's not all about Poland by using code words.

Here, our basic submission -- and the district court agreed with this -- is that it's just not possible to do that because of the nature of the proceeding. But even if you were hesitant about that, I think that there are a couple of other reasons to be resistant to this code words approach that Respondents have advanced now. One of them is a concern that even the Ninth Circuit majority acknowledged and that Judge Gould highlighted in his dissent from the panel, which is that the purpose of this inquiry is to take evidence and ship it abroad to be used in a probe of alleged involvement by Polish officials in the CIA's covert activities. And even if that information appears benign, you know, in and of itself, the whole point of the inquiry is to match it up with other information to shed further light on activities and -- and identities that everyone agrees is -- are privileged. And I think that in and of itself is a serious concern to sort of indirectly accomplish what even the Ninth Circuit and Respondents aren't contesting you couldn't do directly by --"

And so I think, to our view, that's reason enough to conclude that the state secrets privilege precludes further discovery here. But, at a minimum, even if you don't get there, I think it's highly relevant to the consideration that Justice Sotomayor discussed under 1782, which is both this request circumvents the MLAT mechanism and the express exception in the negotiated treaty and also that it would be incredibly intrusive and burdensome to have discovery proceed in that fashion."

And for the reasons that Justice Kagan identified, that they were integral to the program, that they'd be testifying under oath about information that they learned in the CIA and that is subject to confidentiality requirements, and that they'd be doing so in a proceeding designed to investigate and prosecute our alleged former allies abroad, that would be viewed as a serious breach of trust. Thank you, Your Honor."
