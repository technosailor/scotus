And this, I think, takes me to Your Honor's first question, which is that, actually, the numbers work in exactly the opposite way, as you suggest. On Respondents' view, there would only be in 1986 -- and the numbers are similar today -- about 12 states in the entire country that would have any burglary offense whatsoever that qualified under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

And whatever the edge cases, whatever the hard cases under the Armed Career Criminal Act, we just don't think that that is this case, given what -- what had been on the books in the states at that time. Now I know there's been some discussion this morning about how offenders would have notice of -- of what is in and what is out, but I think we can point you to the same thing, which is that this was the commonly understood -- understanding of burglary in 1984 and 1986, and so I don't think that it's too much to assume that if you're convicted of burglary under a typical burglary statute, that that will, in fact, be what Congress and what this Court considers burglary for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act."

Secondly, the \"use\" prong of the government's definition that it offers to this Court is an independent reason why Arkansas's law goes beyond any generic definition of burglary that would be acceptable. And, third, if necessary, we would ask this Court to apply the Sixth Amendment rule that Justice Thomas announced in Apprendi and himself laid out in Mathis and Shepard, that ACCA itself violates the Sixth Amendment because it transgresses the jury trial right.

And so, just as the Court has held in the Fourth Amendment context of California versus Carney, just as the HUD regulations that we cite at page 11 of our brief lay out, just as the state law like Tennessee lays out, just like local law, like local zoning law we cite on the same page of our brief, they all distinguish between floating homes and mobile homes, which are designed to be stationary on the one hand, and put those in the structure category, or a -- or a dwelling or a residence category. On the other hand, there are things like recreational vehicles, sleeper vans, and boats that have sleeping quarters that have always been in the vehicle category, and the reason why is because the principal purpose of those objects is transportation. They can be used incidentally for overnight accommodation and they are occasionally used, but I want to stress to the Court it's only occasional."

By contrast, when it's burglary of a non-residential structure, the percentage goes down to .17 percent, which translates to one out of every 700 crimes that involve what a state would expansively call burglary of a non-residential structure."

Secondly, we have the purpose of ACCA, which is laid out at great length in the Taylor opinion, where, again, the Court said, in much the same words as the residual clause, what Congress was worried about were particular crimes where there's a risk of -- inherent risk of physical injury and not only the inherent risk but a awareness on the fact of the perpetrator that that risk was present."

I would ask you also, in -- as you look sort of as a matter of first principles, if you have any doubt as to how to resolve this case, we think this is a case that really cries out for the rule of lenity. Another important aspect of notice, of course, is for defendants to have fair understanding of what conduct would qualify for a given sentencing enhancement. And, if nothing else, the fact that this Court has said on so many occasions that vehicles are out, without any qualifications, without any reservations, and that structures and buildings are in, would have told the ordinary person that -- that vehicles, even like sleeper vans, recreational vehicles, were outside of the definition of generic burglary. If I may, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the specific provision of Arkansas law that was also spoke -- talked about at the beginning of the argument. As I understand the government's position, it's not disputing that an ordinary car would be outside the locational element of burglary. Now the first thing the government said was they didn't think that was before the Court."

And so we think that's enough to decide the case on the Arkansas side. There were some questions earlier about how the Court should think about the categorical approach more generally, and so let me say a couple words about that because I do think it is a fair observation from the Court that part of what's dwindling down the number of states covered by the government's approach in -- in our case is the nature of the categorical approach. Now the Court had fair notice of that. The government told you this in Mathis, and it told you even in Taylor that if you go down these roads, you're going to start to dwindle the number of states. And the Court, I think, had good reasons to do that because, when you turn to the categorical approach, it's not just about Congressional intent, it's about these predictability, fairness, and Sixth Amendment constitutional concerns that have to be in play."

So, given the way that the state statutes play out here, we think that our reading is the one that is consistent with what Congress was -- was trying to do and with Taylor itself. Now, speaking in terms of Taylor, my friend mentioned that Taylor said that the definition that it was taking on was practically identical to the 1984 definition and that that definition only included buildings. What I think -- I apologize, I don't remember exactly who said it -- someone had mentioned, one of the Justices had mentioned that, in fact, the practical difference may make up for the fact -- I believe it was Justice Kavanaugh -- that really the difference between buildings and structures."

If you look at the appendix to our brief in this case, most, if not all, of the states that actually defined \"building\" did so in terms of vehicles, other structures, et cetera. So they had a very broad definition that might not make sense in ordinary English but was what state burglary statutes used."
