And it boggles my mind to think that the aiding and abetting had to have happened on the sea and not on the land because the first -- 1799 imposed criminal liability for wherever the assistance occurred. And so my difficulty is, in understanding your answer, why it is that the ATS would not have seen aiding and abetting as its own form of criminal liability and the issue being whether there were enough ties to the jurisdiction in which it occurred. I take -- I'm not -- I don't need an answer from you that says to me there wasn't enough here."

The contrast between the Torture Victim Protection Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act show that is a policy choice that could go either way and the decision should be made by Congress.

This case alleges violations of long-established norms prohibiting child slavery and forced labor by U.S. corporations from the United States. The founders were particularly concerned about actions of U.S. citizens that might lead to foreign entanglements, and their response was to provide for a federal judicial forum to resolve such disputes based on the rule of law. The recent discovery of legal opinions written by Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph in the 1790s make it clear that the ATS applied when U.S. citizens violated the law of nations on foreign soil and that the ATS's broad language applied to violations beyond the Blackstone norms without any need for further congressional action. These claims fit comfortably within the text, history, and purpose of the ATS and this Court's holding in Sosa, and it should be allowed to proceed."

And then finally I throw into the mix Central Bank, which underscores that aiding and abetting liability is a different thing and that often there are good reasons not to have aiding and abetting liability even when there's primary liability. So whatever I think about the question, I have to at least acknowledge there are good arguments for a lawmaker to consider on both sides of that question, which, again, takes me back to my question wondering whether I'm the right person to be making this pitch to rather than a legislator. Can you help me with that?"

And -- and, basically, the -- the norms about child slavery and forced labor are as -- as quintessential Sosa qualifying norms as could possibly be imagined.

And my concern on that is the language of Sosa doesn't just talk about the norm, as you know, but Footnote 20 specifically directs us to look at the particular perpetrator being sued and the category of perpetrator, whether it's a corporation or individual.

Fourth and finally, for corporate liability, Justice Breyer, in your query what's new, this Court's majority, not the plurality, Justice Kagan, in Jesner, said there are harms to separation of powers and hard policy choices about how to maximize deterrence, foreign investment, and foreign policy. Congress sometimes uses corporate liability and sometimes doesn't, like the TVPA. The queries today about how can we exempt corporations, it makes no sense, could be said about torture, but in the TVPA, Congress said there was no liability for corporations. The fact that there are two reasonable choices shows you should defer to Congress. Same with extraterritoriality. Sometimes Congress extends a statute that way, like genocide, other times it doesn't."
