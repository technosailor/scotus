Now, the question on whether you look at the strength of the government's case as to whether to grant relief, I would tell this Court that's the one issue on which the 20 jurisdictions across the country are divided. Some say the mere fact that a single racially biased juror took that into account in -- in issuing his verdict is enough for relief.",

And then the second area Your Honor raises is the equal protection area, and we think even there, the Court has not distinguished among different types of constitutional violations and said we're going to treat some violations of the Constitution as particularly serious. What the Court said in those cases, we think, Your Honor, is that there has to be special care taken when the government acts based on race, and so some conduct that wouldn't be unconstitutional at all, if it were taken based on some other criteria, is unconstitutional when it's taken based on race.",
