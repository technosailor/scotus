Nothing in the Act supports stripping Georgia's annotations of copyright protection merely because they were prepared by a contractor on behalf of a state agency. Therefore, the crux of the parties' dispute is whether this Court's 19th-century precedents support a decision different from the one that would be reached by applying standard interpretive principles to the Copyright Act's plain text."

Those principles from the judicial context also apply in the law-making context. So, if a lawmaker acts in his capacity as a lawmaker and creates a work in the discharge of his law-making duties that is within the process for creating law, no copyright exists. Now, in this case, this case is going to be controlled, however, by Callaghan. Callaghan upheld a copyright in annotations to judicial decisions by an official court reporter, a salaried public officer of the court, who was appointed and removable by the court."

So, in Howell, Howell compiles, acting on his own, a compilation of the Michigan statutes together with his own annotations. After he does that, Michigan passes a statute authenticating just the -- the statutory portion of his work, and it says, you can treat that statutory portion as though it were published under the authority of the state. And that causes Justice Harlan to write an opinion that says, even though Howell did that work on his own, you can cut and paste that text directly out of his book in order to republish a compilation of the laws because no one can own the laws. The other stuff, which Howell had produced first on his own and the state had never authenticated, remained Howell's property. The exact opposite happens with the OCGA. Lexis produces the annotation for and at the commission of a state commission."

We talked in our brief about why the editors' notes should be copyrightable, why the Dominiak case that my friend on the other side just was describing doesn't undermine our copyright claim. But I think the crucial point on this is that PRO copied the entirety of the OCGA, including the judicial decision summaries that I think are clearly copyrightable under Wheaton and Callaghan. So PRO has to run the table on all portions of the OCGA to get an affirmance here, and I just don't think that they can. The PRO's main argument seems to be that the fact that the OCGA is official means that it cannot be copyrightable."

Under that understanding, we win here. And then the final point that I want to touch on is how affirming the decision below would be very disruptive for states."
