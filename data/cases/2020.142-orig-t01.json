So the data collected by Florida just doesn't support that conclusion, and that's counted just by the anecdotal testimony of these two individuals. Florida's own oyster expert, before he became their expert, he sent an e-mail in 2012 saying that he had inspected one of the bars and it looked like a gravel parking lot due to all the harvesting."

And so the two elements of that. There are limits on the amount of oysters that can be taken from the bay, and then the oyster resource managers have to -- have to reshell the bay and the oyster beds to ensure that there's a sufficient substrate for the new oysters to grow on. And so the combined effect of removing all the oysters from overharvesting and not replacing it with shell that future oysters can grow on has the effect of causing the bay to collapse."

And what the Court's precedents suggest is that the Court will not intervene unless a state can show by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits substantially outweigh the harms. And I think what the Court might be walking into here is becoming a -- a bit of a local water regulator and focusing on Georgia's -- how it handles its permits and -- and how it handles its metering program at a point where doing so would give no benefit to Florida because, even if the Court were to limit these allegedly wasteful practices, it would still result in no benefit to Florida. So we will not -- have not accomplished that side of the cost/benefit analysis, and now the Court will be involved in managing decrees on local water issues."

I'd point you to Hornberger testimony at 2012 and Lettenmaier testimony at 2404. On the 1.4 percent oyster mass, that's a red herring too because that dealt with one bar which is further away from the mouth of the river, and the evidence from Glibert and Kimbro and White was that there would be much more pronounced benefits at the mouth of the river and that could reseed the entire bay. On the 500 CFS, eliminating the conditions that precipitated the crash is a huge benefit."
