The only thing that would otherwise fall under (B)(ii) and, therefore, needs a carveout is the second-stage discretionary decision by the executive to grant asylum to someone who is eligible for it, and that's why \"the granting of relief\" is used in (B)(ii). I think this -- this Court in St. Cyr uses the words \"the actual granting of relief\" on pages 307 and 308 of the opinion, which, of course, is not statutory, but it does show how the -- how that language has been used to distinguish the second-stage granting of relief in the exercise of discretion as opposed to eligibility. There's also a provision that distinguishes the two with respect to the non-citizens' burdens of proof, and that's 1229a, subparagraph (c)(4)(A), which talks about how the non-citizen has the burden to prove eligibility in the first place but then separately also whether they're entitled to relief in the exercise of discretion."

And if that's denied, normally you would expect, again, under the presumption of reviewability and also under the APA, that you would file an action in district court to challenge the legality of U.S. CIS's determination. This is a major flaw in the Eleventh Circuit's approach because the Eleventh Circuit would say you can't challenge that at all, even for an issue of law, because, in their view, that is a judgment that is barred by (B)(i).

As I understood your position, your position is just that the entire phrase \"judgment regarding the granting of relief\" refers to the step 2 determination rather than the step 1 determination, and whatever \"judgment\" means, whether it refers to the official order or some kind of discretionary decision-making along the way or both, your position would still stand, wouldn't it?"

Then -- I'm -- I'm sorry to do this to you -- but we several times, we in St. Cyr, in Bagamasbad, in Pereida very, very recently, cases spanning nearly 50 years of immigration law, all of them distinguish between eligibility and the step 2 discretionary determination, and all of them talk about the discretionary determination as being about whether relief should be granted.
