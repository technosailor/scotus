It doesn't create a private right of action in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. It doesn't create a private right of action in Section 206 of the Investment Advisors Act. That was this Court's decision in Transamerica. So it's not like Congress picked up some sort of clear code word and incorporated it into Section 14(e)."

And, second, the scope question in that case was about whether 14(e) more or less has substantive fairness provisions which wouldn't have been affected by the existence of a private right. I think here it's particularly correct to think of this as an antecedent question because most of Petitioner's arguments for why there has to be a scienter standard turn on the existence of a private right of action. And so that's why we think that it's difficult in this case to go on and assess whether scienter or negligence is appropriate without addressing that antecedent question. That said, if the Court thinks that this was both forfeited, and it doesn't want to exercise its discretion, it could decide that negligence is the appropriate standard here, but only if it thinks that that is sufficiently clear from the text without regard to whether a private right of action exists."

And I would just flag that, as a general matter in the private rights context, it is a pretty common situation in Central Bank, in Sandoval, in Transamerica, that the lower courts are uniform in finding a private right of action that this Court then says doesn't exist because they've been following their earlier precedent. So I -- I -- I do recognize, given, I believe, Justice Ginsburg's question earlier that this does create an anomaly between 14(a) and 14(e) in terms of their enforceability, but that's an anomaly as a result of Sandoval.

As for the culpability standard, scienter is not required under the plain words that Congress chose for this statute or this Court's decisions construing materially indistinguishable language in 17(a) in Aaron, and even in Ernst & Ernst itself, where it said that a standalone reading of Rule 10b-5 would, in fact, support a negligence standard. As for the private right of action, this case presents the exceptionally rare situation where Congress unmistakably intended this very statute to be privately enforceable, despite not including an express private remedy."
