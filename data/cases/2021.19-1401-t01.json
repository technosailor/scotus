Now, if I could just start with the plain text of the statute, words in 1104 -- solely in the interest of participants, for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants, defraying reasonable expenses with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing -- those words foreclose the rule announced by the Seventh Circuit. It is not in the sole and exclusive interest of participants to have to sift through imprudent funds in order to determine which ones are the prudent ones, and yet that is the implication of the Seventh Circuit's rule and the position that the Respondents advance here. In Tibble, in ruling on the statute of limitations question, the Court had to provide enough content for the ongoing duty to monitor imprudent funds and to remove them and, in doing so, drew upon common law principles of trust that required similar action to remove imprudent funds. So long as some options are prudent, say the Respondents, the fiduciary cannot be sued for the imprudent ones."

But let me go back to the focus of what our complaint is, which is that the very same investment was being offered to participants at much higher cost than they should have been able to get because they were entitled to get the institutional share class fees. It would be like if I offered a bottle of water to you, Justice Thomas, and I said, would you like to pay $2 for it or would you like to pay $1 for it? In this case, the Northwestern fiduciary was charging the beneficiaries $2 even though the $1 water -- bottle of water was available. And that is imprudent, we assert, at the pleading stage, and we're entitled to the truth of our averments, that that pleads a -- a cause of action for a breach of fiduciary duty. Now your hypothetical goes to, obviously, a much more difficult question, and that's one that is not in the case directly as we have pleaded it so far, except in a couple of instances, but let me try to address it there. The band of reasonableness is usually going to be tied to some breakdown in process for prudence."

And that's why we plead that Cal Tech reduce the number of its offerings and that the average among these types of plans is about 20 to 40 rather than the 242 in the retirement plan that were being offered by Northwestern. I would acknowledge that it is a harder claim to show that there's consolidation that would reduce fees, but there's a lot of expert testimony and expert analysis of that very situation because, in some instances, they were offering 16 funds that offered the exact same investment mix. And the circumstances now suggest that consolidation will lower fees, it will provide an opportunity for less recordkeeping expense, it will be better for the beneficiaries, and that is to be benefitting -- benefitting the plan."

For three overriding reasons, this Court should affirm the judgment of both courts below that the amended complaint at issue fails to state a claim under ERISA. First, Petitioners' claims are based on a flawed conception of the duty of prudence which overlooks the role that Congress left for participant choice in this context and would strip fiduciaries of the leeway they have always had to consider tradeoffs in addition to cost, such as the impact that minimum investment requirements for institutional class shares would have on providing investment options generally. Second, even if this Court adopts Petitioners' paternalistic conception of the duty of prudence, the amended complaint in this case still fails to state a claim under this Court's pleading precedents."

But the problem with this complaint, Your Honor, is it doesn't plead facts which would allow a reasonable inference that the alternative fees and services they claim should have been provided were even available to the plan. And under this Court's decision in Fifth Third and a basic application of Twombly and Iqbal, that is not sufficient to state a plausible claim. And if it's enough to get around that, just by having a standalone allegation, you should have asked for a waiver, then that's going to drive a hole through Iqbal and Twombly that's going to infect not just ERISA jurisprudence but civil jurisprudence generally. This Court has always said, and it said in Iqbal and Twombly again, that speculative allegations are sufficient."

There's certainly -- we certainly agree that cost is one consideration, but it has to be taken into account along with other tradeoffs, and that's what's missing from their theory.

I mean, there's really no end to the way in which federal courts would be dragged into overseeing this and managing investment plans, which the Court has never done. I mean, the Court in the Jones versus Harris Associates case under the Investment Company Act took a much more prudent approach when -- when it said that if we're going to get into this question of cost differences, they are going to have to show that the cost difference was so disproportionately large that one couldn't get to that, one couldn't look at that and say it was the result of an arms-length negotiation.

Your Honors, the claims here -- if the claims here can proceed, then any plaintiff can subject a plan to the threat of massive damages and millions of dollars of discovery just by alleging that a cheaper fee, asset, or service was available, even if they provide no facts that would support an inference that that -- that fee or service was actually available to the plans. And that would have -- that would drive a hole through the pleading standards that this Court has established in Iqbal and Twombly. It would thrust the courts into a role that they are not well suited to in micromanaging plans.
