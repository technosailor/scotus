They don't make sense when EPA is regulated at a grid-wide or nationwide level. If EPA says we want to reduce coal plants significantly, well, of course, that would always be achievable in the sense it will reduce emissions.

On a nationwide level, the emissions limits have been reached, and so, effectively, there would be no cost to states to engage in that interstate trading to get their limits below the requisite levels. And for that reason, in terms of costs and benefits, what the repealed rule said is no cost savings to states from repealing this because it wouldn't impose any burdens on them and also no further benefits with respect to further emissions reductions because we don't expect that there would be any further emissions reductions under the CPP itself."

But I don't think that there is any anomaly between that kind of correspondence between the best system of emission reduction and how the sources actually choose to comply because, of course, part of EPA's task here is to see what is adequately demonstrated, what is the power sector already doing to control emissions, and -- and that's the starting point for identifying the best system, and they also have to look at cost. So, to the extent that EPA is saying, here's what the power sector is doing to reduce their emissions, it's -- it's just not surprising to see that they would continue to generation shift to satisfy that emission limit."

And then, in cases like UARG or -- or Brown & Williamson or eviction moratorium, the Court has said that if there were any doubt about what it has already articulated as the best interpretation of the statute, that ambiguity would be resolved by the fact that the particular agency action has sweeping consequences based on its costs or the number of people involved or the type of authority claimed. And that's just very different, I think, down the line from how Petitioners are asking the Court to rely on major questions here. First and foremost, there is no agency regulation for the Court to review to evaluate those kinds of effects."

And if I could just use an example of a -- a trading scheme, which is commonplace in this sector, you can imagine a best system that involves a technological solution, like carbon capture and sequestration, paired with trading, and a plant can decide, well, it's cost-effective to put in the -- the carbon capture and storage, we'll do that, and, in fact, we'll reduce our emissions even below the limit and generate a credit. Another plant that's differently situated and would incur far greater expense to put in the technology is going to be better off in the trading system to buy the credit.

And then, finally, with the unheralded power language that you read, you know, this is a statute where the Court has already recognized in American Electric Power that Congress spoke directly to the issue of who EPA should regulate, existing power plants, what it should regulate, their greenhouse-gas emissions, under this exact provision, Section 7411(d). And I acknowledge in a colloquial sense that that seems like a pretty big deal, but that is right in EPA's wheelhouse because this Court already recognized that Congress conferred on EPA, the expert agency, the authority here to make those judgments."
