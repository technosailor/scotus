But I think, more broadly, if you agree with us on the issue of facial insufficiency, the government's fall-back argument, leaving aside its relatively cursory argument on the actual question presented, is that you should apply a severance principle. And not only does that principle have no footing in the actual text of Title III's suppression provision, I think that that would really sort of effectively all but read subparagraph (2) out of that statute. What the government is attempting to do through these various arguments is to create a regime under which only when there is unlawful interception and the fruits of that unlawful interception are introduced can there be suppression. Again, if that were true, why did Congress go on to say in subparagraph (2) essentially that even if communications were lawfully intercepted, there should be suppression when an order is insufficient on its face. And, again, the severance principle on which the government relies, and the government cites various lower court decisions for that proposition, is a principle that was not well established in the law in 1968."}, {"start": 1296.64, "stop": 1308.68, "byte_start": 5216438, "byte_stop": 5264503, "text": "No federal court of appeals, as far as I'm aware, had even recognized that principle.
