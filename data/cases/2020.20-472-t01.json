But the Court could also construe \"extension\" in the temporal sense without requiring continuity, and in that case, it's certainly arguable that a new entrant would not be able to get an extension of the initial exemption, because it didn't have one, without there being any requirement that the extensions have been continuously enjoyed by others."

So we think the context to focus on here is the one in which Congress is acting on benefit programs that have lapsed, and, there, Congress has said benefits resumed after a lapse can be an extension. In addition, as I indicated, where it has wanted to limit the word \"extension\" to be only continuous, it has felt the need to add words like \"consecutive\" or \"successive,\" consecutive extensions or extensions for successive periods. And under Respondents' view, all of the many statutes that talk about extensions for successive or consecutive periods, the words are all surplusage."

And finally, the anomalies I referred to in my opening statement, similarly situated refineries, both facing identical hardship, get treated oppositely because one of them, several years ago, when the statutory demands were lighter, is able -- was able to comply, or the refinery that is never able to comply without hardship gets exemptions indefinitely because they're continuous, but the refinery that occasionally can comply is driven out. None of that, we think, commends Respondents' view of this statute."

And, finally, other textual aspects of this statute -- this is a statute which textually commands that the burdens will intensify year after year after year and textually says that relief is to be given based on hardship. And it does not seem a sensible reconciliation of all these provisions to say that that text and the underlying purpose it indicates would be served by kicking out a small refinery from eligibility for exemption because in one early year of the program it was able to comply without hardship."

But the key thing is that the small refinery provisions are the only ones that are geared to an individual company and its circumstances, so the broader authorities don't deal with that problem.

I -- I think your question really highlights that Congress expected them to be continuous as well, because the study was due at the end of 2008 and the initial exemption extended through the end of 2010. I -- I have to confess, I'm not sure I -- I've thought about what would have happened in the hypothetical world if -- if EPA had not -- or if DOE had not gotten that study in on time and the initial exemptions had lapsed. I do think that would not be the ordinary meaning of -- of \"extension,\" and then the question would be whether the -- the context of the statute so clearly compels the availability of extensions that you'd have to -- to look otherwise, but -- but I don't think that that's presented here."

Moreover, once a refinery has developed a mechanism for compliance, it can actually -- as I just mentioned, it can actually recover those compliance costs, so there is no disadvantage from one to the other.

The first is simple language in (B)(i), which limits EPA's authority only to extending the exemption in (A)(i) which Congress said would be temporary and time-limited. The second is, in the same way Congress used \"extension\" in the rest of Section 211, all throughout the Clean Air Act, when it uses \"extension,\" it does prolong continuously the duration of something preexisting. And I do believe, lastly, that if continuity is clear in the words Congress did not choose, that if it had chosen \"reinstate,\" \"restart,\" \"renew,\" or taken the most simple path of just saying that someone could petition for an exemption, that would lend toward a non-continuous --"
