At the very least, that's a plausible reading of the statute that ought to be adopted under the canon of constitutional avoidance because it would eliminate any overbreadth concern. Prohibitions on soliciting or facilitating both criminal and civil violations have long been common and have never been thought to raise a First Amendment problem because, as the Court held in Williams, the First Amendment does not protect speech that is intended to induce or commence specific illegal activities. Now I acknowledge that it will sometimes be hard to draw the line between protected advocacy and unprotected solicitation, but that problem is not unique to Section 1324. Exactly the same issue can arise under any solicitation or aiding-and-abetting statute. And, more importantly here, that is not an overbreadth problem."

I welcome the Court's questions."

So how do we tell all those people not to chill speech because the only thing being punished under this statute, unless you want me to add that it has to say that the statute requires something more than just words, we're criminalizing words related to immigration. And I thought there were only certain statutes that were immune to First Amendment challenges, obscenity, fighting words. Otherwise, everything else is subject to the First Amendment and strict scrutiny. So why should we uphold a statute that criminalizes words, makes the punishment five years, which is rather significant? I know of no other statute where aiding-and-abetting punishment or solicitation punishment is greater than the punishment we're giving the person who's going to commit the crime."

My second assumption is that for one or another reason, maybe it's what Justice Alito said about the fact that this is civil conduct, maybe it's for another reason, my second assumption is that this statute as applied to those people would -- would be unconstitutional. And now I want you to tell me how to do the overbreadth analysis on this, because I -- I think I might say to you, I can imagine that there's, like, a whole -- a huge number of such communications taking place every day because, for every person who's in this country unlawfully, there are probably some number of people who want that person to stay, family members, you know, whatever.

If the justification for treating speech as categorically unprotected is that it is integral to conduct that the government can punish, then the speech cannot be punished more harshly than that conduct. This Court has consistently resisted prior invitations to expand categories of unprotected speech and should do the same here. Otherwise, Congress and the states will be free, without any First Amendment scrutiny, to criminalize speech soliciting violations of the vast range of administrative and regulatory laws that govern us today, from mask and vaccine mandates to parking ordinances. To deny the government's requested expansion would only mean that it would have to satisfy ordinary First Amendment scrutiny when it regulates such speech. And, finally, even if the Court were to adopt the government's narrowing construction, Mr. Hansen's convictions must be vacated because the jury was not instructed to apply the government's narrowing construction, and the government argued that the plain meaning of the statute should control. I welcome the Court's questions."

It required specific intent to solicit a particular felony, and it required circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent.

I do want to go back to, Justice Gorsuch, your question about this particular defendant and his conduct. In R.A.V. v. St. Paul, the -- the opinion for the Court noted that just because someone engages in conduct that could be regulated in one way doesn't mean that the government can regulate it in another way that violates the First Amendment. So there you had a defendant who burned a cross in a family's yard, and Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court noted that arson laws, property damage laws could have gotten that defendant's behavior, but that didn't mean the application of a viewpoint discriminatory law was permissible with respect to him."

As Justice Gorsuch said, I think there's a real question whether even if they're right that there's constitutional questions about soliciting or facilitating civil conduct, whether that meets the high threshold for overbreadth.

And the judgment that Congress made here is that when someone solicits or facilitates immigration violations, they are deserving of more punishment than the noncitizens, who are already subject to removal. We think that's a reasonable judgment. And within the contours of that judgment, I think it's important to emphasize that Congress treated speech and conduct exactly the same. Whether solicitation or facilitation takes the form of speech or takes the form of conduct, this statute treats it identically, and so I don't think it has the effect of treating speech worse than conduct that my colleague describes.
