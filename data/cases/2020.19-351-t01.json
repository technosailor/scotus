Judge Katsas pointed out in his dissent from denial of rehearing en banc that in the context of the kinds of claims that the plaintiffs asserted here, that the scheme they propose oddly matches the jurisdictional equivalent of a thermonuclear weapon, determining the scope of genocide, to the merits equivalent of swatting a fly, which is looking at the underlying merits, determining whether there was a common law conversion. Would -- in the private context that -- that everybody agrees could go forward under the international law of takings if this were a suit brought by foreign nationals, would that involve the court in the same kind of quagmire that Judge Katsas is identifying here, having to determine the scope of a genocide, or does resort to the international law of takings give the court a clean way of deciding it without having to get into the human rights aspect?"

I'd like to, I guess, raise three reasons for skepticism about the broad reading of (a)(3) that plaintiffs provide, and the first two track what you heard earlier of Simon. Under plaintiffs' view of the expropriation exception, it's easier to sue a foreign sovereign than it is to sue a private defendant under the ATS because, under the ATS, Kiobel makes clear that foreign-cubed cases don't belong in U.S. courts. The second is there's no serious account of reciprocity concerns."

Respondents, though, have sought to sue in U.S. court, but the exception to sovereign immunity on which they rely is limited to violations of the international law of takings or expropriations, which has long prohibited only the taking of a foreign national's property if done without compensation. That interpretation is confirmed by the parallel provision of the Restatement in effect when the FSIA was enacted, and the exception's statutory history is part of Congress's response to the uncompensated expropriation of Americans' property by Cuba and others. By contrast, to read the expropriation exception as opening U.S. courts to suits based on human rights violation would constitute a major department -- departure from the FSIA's text, structure, and context, and require U.S. courts to make sensitive judgments about a foreign state's treatment of the persons within its territory."

So, in showing special solicitude for Nazi-era claims, the Clarification Act clearly assumes that some such claims against Nazi-era confiscations of property would be going forward and that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would not bar them. So, if your interpretation of the expropriation exception is correct to say that it applies only when there's a foreign national suing a government for the taking of property, what kind of class of claims are those? I guess I would open up some of the difficult questions of nationality and citizenship that Justice Alito was asking you, but could we expect there would have been or was there a large subset of claims brought against Nazi governments -- Nazi-controlled governments by foreign nationals? What -- what is Congress referring to there?"

So, really, what Congress was doing was not taking away the opportunity of someone who had such a claim to rely on the loan of property to a U.S. museum as establishing the commercial nexus, but it didn't do more than that.

One thing I wanted to ask you about, and give you an opportunity to respond, is the current Restatement, the Restatement Fourth, you're well aware the reporter's note, Section 455, says that by eliminating the domestic takings rule and permitting claims to proceed on allegations of takings incurred -- occurred in the context of egregious violations of international law, this line of decisions -- referring to the current cases we're talking about -- this line of decisions appears to expand the scope of 1605(a)(3) well beyond the original intent of the Congress, potentially opening courts of the United States to a wide range of property-related claims arising out of foreign internal conflicts characterized by widespread human rights violations. So what's your response to the reporter's note in the current Restatement saying that this line of decisions goes well beyond what Congress would have understood?"
