Our position is that, here, where the statute has not carved out those kind of exceptions, if you're dealing with commercial activity, state law ought -- ought to apply. We don't think that there will be situations in which there would be a special rule for the foreign state than for the private actors. There might be situations in which, under act of state or comity or any of a variety of other provisions, the Court might limit what a private party could get just as it might limit what a state party could get based on considerations of comity and international law and the like. But I think the command of Section 1606 is that whatever rules are going to be applied to a private party should be applied to the foreign state when it's acting in its commercial activities."

So we -- we think that when the Congress enacted the FSIA against all of those backgrounds, even in the absence of such a clear congressional command as exists in 1606, the right interpretation of the FSIA would be that it did not indicate an intent to deviate from the use of state law and state choice-of-law issues.

As Justice Breyer indicated in his last question, if every fact in this case were the same, but the foundation were a private art gallery, everyone agrees that a court would use state choice-of-law rules to select the rule of decision for Petitioners' property claims.

Klaxon recognizes that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the forum's choice of law, but FSIA cases do not arise under diversity jurisdiction. Moreover, Klaxon's stated goal of deterring plaintiffs from shopping for a more favorable forum by taking their state law claims across the street to a federal court is not relevant as Congress wanted FSIA cases to be litigated in federal courts. I would be happy to address any questions that the Court may have."

The basic point I want to make is that the Respondent cites no case and we are aware of none where this Court has separated state choice of law from state rule of decision. Whether it is viewed under the Rule of Decision Act, whether it's viewed under the Klaxon decision, this Court has repeatedly declined to separate state choice of law from state rule of decision where state causes of action were involved. In this particular case, Congress has been clear in Section -- Section 1606 that the state actors should be liable in the same manner to the same extent as the private party under like circumstances. There's no way, I respectfully suggest, that you can read that language and say that you can have different choice-of-law rules apply when a state actor is involved than when a private museum's involved."
