But we think that in order to avoid the situation that we currently have, where we have endless line-drawing and judicial supervision, pocket -- punctuated by requests for treble damages, it's important for the Court to speak clearly here.

I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal -- Federal Baseball, and that -- that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it -- it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing."

For over a hundred years, the NCAA has administered procompetitive amateurism rules needing to account for multiple constituencies and changing circumstances, as the questions today illustrate. It offends the antitrust laws for a court to appoint itself as a superintendent to second-guess those judgments, blurring the distinction between college and professional sports, and facilitating successive lawsuits and treble damages award, all based on supposed evidence that an alternative regime of the court's devising wouldn't diminish net viewer interest. This is the one and only case in the history of the Sherman Act ever to strike down restraints that are what differentiates the product, and particularly in the unique circumstances here, it was manifest error to do so.

That -- that's the gloss that Mr. Waxman attempted to put on it, but there's nothing in the injunction that prevents the NCAA from enforcing criteria, for example, on whether there should be actual benchmarks, certain GPAs, to make sure that these awards actually reward academic achievement and aren't used as disguised pay-for-play payments.

I -- I'd note too that I think the parties took their lead from Board of Regents because, there, the Court did clearly contemplate that a procompetitive justification could be based on the idea of preserving college sports as a distinct product and seemed to think that that would justify restraints in this market.

At -- at step 3, the question has to be whether there is a less restrictive alternative that's as effective in preserving the NCAA's conception, not one that's as effective in preserving some kind of differentiation between the NCAA and pro sports. Just focusing on differentiation as an abstract conception would allow courts to completely replace a business's product with one of the court's own making as long as it was still differentiated. At step 3, the less restrictive alternative has to preserve the same type and degree of benefit shown at step 3."

Once carts -- courts start drawing their own lines -- and according to the government here, everything is factual and depends on the record -- perpetual litigation and judicial superintendence are inevitable. Just the $5980 that has so captured the Court's imagination this morning required months of posttrial litigation in front of this judicial superintendent just to figure out what that number is for the time being.
