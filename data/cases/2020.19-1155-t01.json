The Ninth Circuit rejected the agency's reasoning because it concluded that the absence of an adverse credibility determination entitled a reviewing court to disregard some record evidence and to treat the alien's allegations of persecution as fact. Similarly, in Alcaraz, the court of appeals expressly relied on the erroneous principle that the absence of an adverse credibility determination permits a presumption of truth, and it applied that presumption to justify ignoring the ample evidence underlying the agency's determination that Alcaraz committed a particularly serious crime when he willfully inflicted corporal injury on the 17-year-old mother of his child. The Ninth Circuit therefore subverted the statutory scheme that Congress created. Rather than placing the burden on the alien, the court presumed the truth of the alien's testimony, and rather than deferring to the agency's reasonable fact-finding, it supplanted the agency's judgment with its own. Accordingly, the court of appeals' decisions cannot stand."

And so, in Dai, we think that the agency pointed out that even though Dai said that his wife had been persecuted along with him in China, there was evidence demonstrating that his wife had voluntarily returned to China just about two weeks after they -- they -- his family came."

And then, third, when the asylum officer asked Dai for the real story behind his travel to the United States, he said to make a better life for his child and to -- because he didn't have a job. He did not reference the persecution. And I think the fact that he said the real story, he recounted the real story without referencing persecution at all, that too undermines the persuasiveness of his testimony that he wanted to stay -- he needed to stay in the United States because of persecution. So I think, in Dai, there are three pieces of very strong evidence that undermines the persuasiveness of the alien's testimony, even if you assume for the purposes of analysis, for the limited purposes of analysis, that Dai testified credibly.

So all we are left with is a purely fact-bound issue of whether, in this specific case, once the presumption is applied, the Board had substantial evidence that a particularly serious crime was committed. I'm not sure that this question alone would be cert-worthy, but, in any event, the answer to that is easy because the Board provided no reasoned explanation for rejecting Alcaraz's testimony, which the government admits had to be presumed credible. The government made a remarkable concession that for the legal standard that Encino Motorcars requires that \"the pathway must be clearly discerned,\" to use Ms. Sinzdak's words. Here, that's impossible to discern. As the court of appeals found, the Board's decision was based on \"a probation report which directly contradicts Alcaraz's testimony.\" If that court were to ask why did the Board believe one account and not the other, it would have to guess, was it based on a reason at odds with the record, arbitrary, or something else? Did the immigration judge overlook the only eyewitness account from the mom, which is curiously never mentioned by the -- by the IJ or by the Board? Did he misunderstand Alcaraz's no contest plea? Did he think Alcaraz agreed with the probation office report even though that report was written months after the plea? If this Court is to endorse the application of the government's rule today, it set a new basement level standard for the quantum of reasoning an agency must offer to support its factual findings, one that would radiate far beyond immigration throughout the administrative state. This Court should decline that invitation and affirm."
