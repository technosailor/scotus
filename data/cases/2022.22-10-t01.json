So all indications are what Congress was doing is targeting a particularly egregious form of fraud, use of somebody's name through stealing it, misappropriating it, or -- or impersonating the person, identity theft. But, if the government is right and if the Fifth Circuit is right about how broad the statute is, what it would do is it would transform fraud prosecutions to having every one of them be essentially an aggravated identity theft prosecution too, and that would thwart's Congress's careful design. The Court should reverse, and I'm happy to answer any questions the Court has."
