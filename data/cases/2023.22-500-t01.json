So I think, here, you are right there's no decision from this Court on choice of law, but you have a uniform history in the lower courts, you have a virtual consensus among all the present-day courts, all the major maritime ones, and you already have Bremen and Carnival. So you already know what the rule is with respect to forum selection, and it's thus, I think, an even easier question here."

On the non-marine-insurance contracts, I think they're going to have to say still the same test as forum selection, but for the one choice-of-law clause in the one marine insurance contract, you'd look at Wilburn Boat and say: Ah, well, their state should play a role."

Another thing is, to the extent we're talking about federal interests overarching this entire dynamic, we know, as Justice Sotomayor says, the federal interests are in uniformity and predictability and all of those sorts of things. So, if we have a single federal spokesperson regarding what is accepted, you're more likely to advance the interests of uniformity and predictability, whereas if you have state interests operating in the exception, you're going to have all of these different exceptions popping up at different times and people aren't going to know what they're doing. So I appreciate that there's a world in which insurance contracts are different and they're ordinarily run by the states and each state has a particular interest, consumer protection, not, or whatever, but if our entire kind of framing is about ensuring predictability and uniformity, why would we have a world in which we would allow different state policy interests to be driving the exception in this way?"
