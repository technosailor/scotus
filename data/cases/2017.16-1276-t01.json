And we know that Congress wanted those two anti-retaliation regimes to coexist, because in the very same section of Dodd-Frank that added the Dodd-Frank anti-whistleblower provision, Section 922, Congress also amended, and to some extent expanded, the protection for whistleblowers more generally in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."}, {"start": 637.96, "stop": 678, "byte_start": 2581623, "byte_stop": 2741806, "text": "Those are subsections (a) and (c) of Section 922 more generally.

And, tellingly, the SEC itself, in the regulation at issue here, seemed to recognize that absurdity because at the same time that the SEC unexpectedly dispensed with the requirement of reporting to the SEC, it sought implicitly to narrow the category of disclosures that are covered by the third clause to disclosures involving securities law violations or Section 1514(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley.
