But with regard to administrability, I just want to be clear about how this works, because this is obviously a very important practical issue for district courts.

But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your best argument? I mean, aren't you then admitting that the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?",
