  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for the discharge of pollutants to navigable waters from point sources, which the CWA defines as \u201cdiscernible, confined, and discrete conveyances.\u201d In contrast, all other sources of pollution are characterized as nonpoint sources and are controlled through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other non-CWA programs. The CWA also distinguishes between groundwater and navigable waters, the latter being \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d and exclusive of the former.</p>\n<p>Constructed with funding by the EPA in the 1970s, the County of Maui\u2019s Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility treats wastewater generated by homes and business in the western part of Maui by injecting treated wastewater (called \u201ceffluent\u201d) into underground injection control (UIC) wells\u2014a common method used by municipalities to dispose of effluent. Before injection, effluent is treated to meet R-1 water standards, Hawaii\u2019s highest standards for recycled water. Some of the treated effluent is used for resort and golf course irrigation. Upon injection, effluent immediately mixes with groundwater and disperses vertically and horizontally, eventually migrating to the ocean. Over 90% of the effluent/groundwater mixture enters the ocean through diffuse flow, with no identifiable entry point. Reports from 1973, 1991, and 1994 indicate that both the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) understood that the wastewater entered the ocean, and neither agency suggested that this result required NPDES permitting.</p>\n<p>The district court at summary judgment held that the County violated the CWA by discharging effluent through groundwater and into the ocean without the NPDES permit required by the CWA, and that the County had fair notice of its violations. The court based its ruling on findings that the County \u201cindirectly discharged[d] a pollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit,\u201d (2) the groundwater is a \u201cpoint source\u201d as defined by the CWA, and (3) the groundwater is a \u201cnavigable water\u201d under the CWA. The County appealed, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court.</p>\n",
