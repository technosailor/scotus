The first is that, in October of 2010, when the FDA ultimately decided that an addition to the warnings and precautions section of these labels was warranted, it rejected Merck's proposal that the warning include repeated uses of the term \"stress fracture\". And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so. At page 670 of the Joint Appendix, Merck kind of, in the introductory section of its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the warning that it's proposing to add, and it says at the very top of the page: Merck is proposing to add language to both the precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing experience section of the label to describe low-energy fractures that have been reported, of which some have been stress insufficiency at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft."

The second thing I'd like to point out in that regard is what my colleague was referring to as the -- Merck's own explanation for its use of the term \"stress fracture\".

If the FDA told Merck that, then it's impossible. But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, then it's not impossible for Merck to change its label, and it has responsibility over its label, and to the extent that it thinks that the literature supports a change, it should change its label."

In other words, at the time of the CRL, based on all of the information that the FDA had before it, and it doesn't claim that it was misled, no warning was justified at that time. In March of 2010, the public safety announcement, Joint Appendix 520, the FDA said \"the data did not show an increase in this risk in women using this medication.\" In light of that statement from the FDA, there is no way that Merck could have changed its warning because the FDA has told us that no warning was justified at that time.
