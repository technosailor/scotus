So the reason it couldn't just refer to 841 is because it was also dealing with Section 3, which addressed a different problem with regard to simple crack possession. And I think, you know, I would -- I would sort of turn it around and say, well, if Congress wanted to do what amicus said, then it just would have -- it would have drafted the exact same statute and just substituted the word \"amended\" for \"modified,\" and it gets exactly to where amicus says that Congress wanted to go. So, of course, Congress might have drafted this in an entirely different way, but -- but, based on the statute we have and the two competing interpretations that are in front of the Court, our interpretation is textually sound when you read the phrase \"statutory penalties\" in context, and that's the fundamental flaw with amicus's theory."

One is that \"statutory penalties\" -- I think, again, the amicus agrees on this -- has to refer to the shifting of the ranges, not to modification of any term of years sentences because, of course, the Fair Sentencing Act didn't do the latter thing. So we're already in a world where we're talking about shifting ranges as changed statutory penalties, and that shift is illustrated on page 7 of our reply brief and it's quite dramatic. The second linkage I would point the Court to, as I was just discussing with Justice Kagan, is the Court's opinion in Dorsey, where it was well understood and, in fact, a reason for the holding in Dorsey that the statutory changes were going to necessitate changes to the guidelines to conform with it. And you don't have to take my or Mr. Adler's word for what a judge would normally think if he's looking or she is looking at a zero to 28 range as opposed --"

First, he's effectively requiring this Court to insert the word \"effectively\" before the word \"modified.\" Because Section 2 didn't change the ranges, that -- he's asking the Court to say that it effectively modified the ranges, and that's just not part of the statute. Second, his interpretation is inconsistent with the past tense \"were modified.\" His argument depends on defining the violation as a pre-Section 2 50- and 5-gram offense, but no statutory penalties for those offenses were modified by Section 2 because the Fair Sentencing Act applied only prospectively. So his -- his interpretation is inconsistent with the past tense. Finally, something that occurred to me, his interpretation would categorically exclude all pre-Apprendi offenders because none of them had 5 or 50 grams as an element of their offense when they were convicted, and there have been 2- to 300 pre-Apprendi offenders who have obtained relief under Section 404, and they would have all been excluded under amicus's view. Finally, amicus referred several times to Dorsey and at one point said that our interpretation of the language would sort of do violence to the English language."
