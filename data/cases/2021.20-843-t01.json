Here, I think the reasoning works the opposite direction, which is you typically have a baseline right to carry for self-defense, and the only historical analogs that really restricted the right of a typical law-abiding citizen to carry for self-defense to the same degree as the New York law here were those laws, very few, typically post-Reconstruction laws that purported to eliminate any right to carry, openly or concealed."

But, of course, the second reason is it's just about that time that the collective rights view started to creep into the decisions of some state supreme courts. And I think -- so in Heller is a perfect example that this Court didn't absolutely stop its analysis in 1871, but, when it looked at those later sort of postbellum state supreme court decisions, the ones that relied on a collective rights view were given very short shrift."

One is I wouldn't feel any differently with respect to my two individual clients, who were denied their right to exercise their Second Amendment rights. But, more broadly, the reason I'm so confident that this regime is problematic on its face is because, on its face, at least as interpreted by the highest court in New York, the requirement you need to show in order to carry concealed for self-defense but not for hunting and target practice is you have to show that you have a need for self-defense that distinguishes you from the generalized community, from the general community. So New York's law on its face says that the only way that you can carry for self-defense is if you demonstrate your atypicality with respect to your need for self-defense."

It seems to me that if we're looking at that history and tradition with respect to concealed arms that there is not the same requirement that there is in the home. One of the things Heller pointed to was there were few regulations that prohibited the carrying or the keeping of arms in homes.

In fact, the relief we've asked for is to have an unrestricted license because, under New York law as it currently exists, that's the only way that you can have a carry right for a handgun. But, in framing our relief in the complaint, we, you know, framed it so that there are other relief consistent with the decision. So, if New York really wanted to say, you know, no, we have a particular problem with concealed carry, notwithstanding that traditionally that's the only way we allow people to carry, if they want to shift to an open carry regime, they could do that consistent with everything we've said here. Now I don't think anybody expects that to happen because, if you look at the New York law specifically, it's a law that prohibits the carrying of handguns except for permit holders, and then its provisions about permit holders speak specifically to concealed carry. So that's why we've framed our request the way we have."

So I think, if you did one of those two things -- either make clear that it's text, history, and tradition outside the home as well as inside or made clear that narrow tailoring is an integral component of the test -- that would go a long way to clearing up some of the confusion in the lower courts."

And the one U.S. early court that dealt with this, the common law equivalent of the statute, was State against Huntly in North Carolina, which was an opinion that was cited favorably in the majority opinion in Heller, and that case went out of its way to say that simply carrying firearms per se is not an offense; it's the intent to terrorize the people that is prohibited by Northampton."

As to the general question about Heller, we agree completely that the Court ought to apply the method from Heller, which we, like I think all the parties, take to be look to the text, history, and tradition of the Second Amendment right, and we're applying that now to a somewhat different issue with the benefit of somewhat broader materials. Now, as to the question about why you have to have a showing of need, I think the problem with Mr. Clement's formulation is that it assumes the conclusion. If you had a right, the Second Amendment conferred a right to carry around a weapon for possible self-defense just because an individual wants to have one available, then, obviously, you couldn't take away that right or make it contingent upon a discretionary determination. But the whole question is whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms confers that right to have a pistol with you for self-defense even absent a showing of demonstrated need."

The Andrews case that he relies on and that Heller relies on as well is actually more helpful to us because the Court upheld a prohibition on the carrying of belt or pocket pistols, and it prohibited a ban on revolvers only because the Court construed that ban to be so broad that it would prohibit even carrying it around your house. And in the very next sentence, the Court said: But, of course, the legislature, if it wanted to, could regulate the carrying of that firearm publicly. And then, when you turn to laws like the ones that we have here, which include some sort of self-defense exception, either ex-ante or ex-post, the trend in the cases is in favor of -- of upholding their constitutionality. We've cited about six decisions from the 1800s and the early 1900s, including the Duke and English cases from Texas, the Isaiah case from Alabama, the Haley and Fife cases from Arkansas, and the Workman case from West Virginia, all of which upheld those laws. And Mr. Clement's answer to those decisions is that they rested on the erroneous understanding that the Second Amendment or its state equivalents protected only the right to use arms in the militia. But that is not what those cases say. They do not stop by saying that the defendants were not militiamen and so had no rights."

And our submission is that when it's an option that New York has and other states have had for a century or more and that traces as far back as some of the laws that I've been discussing into our nation's history, that's an option that is consistent with our tradition of gun regulation and is an option that ought to be available to the states."

But what does that show about the original understanding of the right that's protected by the Second Amendment? Would -- would we be receptive to arguments like that if we were interpreting, let's say, the First Amendment or the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment? Would we say, well, you know, you can find a lot of state laws and state court decisions from the late -- from the 19th Century, early 20th Century, that are inconsistent with a claim that is made based on the original meaning of -- of a provision of the Bill of Rights, and that shows that that's what that was understood to mean at the time?"

But I find it hard to understand how later decisions and statutes, particularly when you start to get into the late 19th Century and the early 20th Century, can be used as a substitute for evidence about what the right was understood to mean in 1791 or 1868 if you think that's the relevant date."

But, when Heller turned to the question presented here, which is what sorts of regulations are consistent with the right that it was recognizing, I think it's fairly read to extend the analysis into the 20th Century for the reason that Justice Kagan identified, that it validated as presumptively lawful felon-in-possession requirements, bans on the possession of firearms by the mentally ill that date to much later than the 19th Century."
