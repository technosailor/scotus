Finally, as to remedies, the APA did not create a novel remedy of universal vacatur, and the INA specifically bars that remedy. Section 1252(f)(1) prohibits the lower courts from granting coercive relief against the operation of the covered INA provisions, and vacatur is plainly coercive. I welcome the Court's questions."

Why isn't it possible -- and let's say that I agree with you and agree with some of the scholarship that says that this was not contemplated at the time of the APA's enactment. Why can't remedial authority evolve over time? You know, even if injunctions and declaratory judgments are what those, you know, who enacted the APA, Congress at the time, scholars at the time, Jaffe, thought that didn't -- vacatur didn't occur to them. Remedial authority is a flexible concept, and so maybe the courts of appeals have expanded that concept."

The terms \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" in 1252(f)(1) speak to two traditional kinds of injunctive relief: injunctions and temporary restraining orders. And perhaps if there were other orders that operated like them in key regards, which is to say they operated in personam, they had a prohibitory or a mandatory character, it might bar those as well. Vacatur is, as this Court has put in Monsanto, a much less drastic remedy, and the most important way in which it's less drastic can easily be seen by the perspective of someone who, in fact, has been enjoined. A party who's been enjoined to do or not do something is effectively under the supervision of a federal district judge and has to go to that district judge or suffer their counterparty going to that district judge if they want to attempt to re-implement or otherwise take the action that's been -- that's been subject to that injunction."

Now my friend on the other side said quite -- quite candidly that in the event that Texas were to have received a declaration, of course, and I believe her words were, the United States would follow that declaration or would be bound by it. It's very hard to explain how it is that vacatur, which acts against -- directly against a rule and does not in personam bind any officer or agency of the United States, is coercive or otherwise prohibited in the meaning of 1252(f)(1), but that declaratory relief, which the United States acknowledges it would, in fact, follow, is somehow not coercive. I think -- I think that line is evanescent, if it exists at all, and so the best reading of 1252(f)(1) is only to injunctions and those sorts of orders and that Texas, the state --"

But, more importantly, Congress actually considered this exact excuse in the transition rules following IIRAIRA, where Congress gave the executive two years, saying, if the executive in any given 1226 case believes it simply does not have the enforcement ability, doesn't have the resources, that will excuse mandatory detention. After two years, the executive went back to Congress and asked for renewal of that. Congress said no, and then immediately, then the Clinton Administration acknowledged that the obligations under 1226(c) became mandatory."

Now what do we do with this? We -- are we supposed -- are we left to do all of the scholarship that would be required to figure out whether this new interpretation is the correct interpretation?
