That result is unlawful substantively under the Pecos River Compact and procedurally under this Court's 1988 amended decree. New Mexico and the River Master have offered only two theories justifying these delivery credits, but each violates the plain text of the compact that Congress approved. New Mexico's lead argument is Article XII, but, as the United States correctly points out, Article XII cannot and does not justify the River Master's decision."

Well, you can see that Texas admits that the water is stored for their benefit, at both pages 80a of the Texas appendix and page 108 of the New Mexico appendix, which is a letter from 2017 and a position paper to the River Master in which they acknowledge, yes, this water was stored after March for our benefit and based on our request. And you can see at page 68 of the -- the Texas appendix that Reclamation agreed it was holding that water for -- for Texas and indicated, as I -- as I said earlier, that if Texas had started to negotiate a Warren Act contract, that water would have continued to be held.

But, in 1987, the Court eliminated the special master and appointed the River Master and imbued him with very limited technical powers to perform technical calculations and nothing more. And since that time, things have gone great."
