What you would want to be asking is, how small is this comparison in comparison -- how small is this class in comparison to all of the other automated calls that might be made if the TCPA were not in force? Second, with respect to potential discrimination between collectors of government-backed debts and collectors of other debts, the distinction that we've pointed to is that the collection of government-backed debts implicates the distinct federal interest in protecting the federal fisc, and it's not unusual for Congress to prefer federal debt collection efforts. For example, if Congress says the federal government can collect debts owed to it by offset on a tax return -- a tax refund or Social Security benefits, the private predators can't do that, or if the federal government has greater capacity to garnish wages, that there's nothing problematic about that, that the last thing we would say is collectors of private debts could petition the FCC for an exception. They could say, there's no good reason to treat us differently and, therefore, you, the FCC, should exercise your statutory authority to create an exception for all debt collection calls as to which the recipient is not charged. And then the FCC would either grant or deny that."

So let me give you an example, a fanciful example that tries to reduce both of those things perhaps to their lowest limit. Suppose there was a total ban on automated calls to cell phones or to all phones, but there was one tiny exception for, let's say, calls between noon and 1 p.m. on the 4th of July that contained this simple message: Happy Birthday, America. And let's say that the statute allowing this contains a provision that says that if the inclusion of this exception renders the statute unconstitutional, the statute itself shall remain in force and the exception shall be stricken. So would you say even in that situation the whole statute would have to fall?"

The exception, you know, again, assuming that the exception was big enough to actually create a problem of constitutional deficiency with the statute, the exception is evidence of why the restriction is unjustified.

If you thought that the only problem with the statute was not the justification for the restriction but, rather, the fact that there's differential treatment, we think that you still as a First Amendment matter for a number of the reasons already mentioned, that you would still need to get rid of the restriction. But, even if you didn't agree with us on that, I think there's -- our fallback position would be the position the Third Circuit took in the Rappa case, which is that you'd need very specific evidence of congressional intent.
