And the way I know is how this played out in the capital context, right? So the Court first decides Woodson, which deals with a mandatory death penalty, very similar to Miller, and then the Court has a whole series of cases after Woodson, some of which really are very close to what you said, Justice Kagan, where the sentencer is not formally required to impose death but says I'm not going to consider youth.

But assuming that this was a discretionary scheme, Jones II, the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in that case, says that a defendant in Malvo's position -- and Jones was, I think, similarly situated to Malvo in this respect -- was able to seek suspension of all or part of his sentence on any ground, including youth. And if that is correct and that is -- and if that is sufficient for a scheme to be considered discretionary under Miller, then I don't think he has a claim under Miller."
