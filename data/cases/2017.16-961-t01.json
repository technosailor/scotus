The dual office-holding ban incorporates this distinction, prohibiting active-duty military officers from holding a second office that requires nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate absent express congressional authorization, while generally allowing military officers to be assigned to exercise the duties of such positions. That's why when the four judges at issue here began to serve as appointed judges on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban and disqualified them from hearing the Petitioners' appeals. Congress created the Court of Military Commission Review in 2006 as part of the Military Commissions Act, and the initial plan for the CMCR was modeled very much on the then-existing courts of criminal appeals in the court-martial system, right down to how the judges were to be selected."}, {"start": 84.56, "stop": 130.8, "byte_start": 368111, "byte_stop": 553058, "text": "So, in the original language of the 2006 Act, judges could be assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the CMCR, and those judges could either be civilians or military officers.

The Court in Weiss went through the history of the military justice system in the court-martial side of the house and explained the role that military officers had long played in that system, and it concluded that, as a result of that role, serving as a judge on the court of criminal appeals is germane to holding military office. Obviously, the Court in Weiss did not have in front of it Section 973, but we think its conclusion on germaneness is very instructive on this question because the Court of Military Commission Review performs a function that is very similar to the function performed by the courts of criminal appeals.

And I think what that illustrates, and, by the way, I don't understand my friend to dispute that a judgeship on the court of criminal appeals is a military office, not a civil office of the sort that would be contemplated in Section 973. And what that shows is that even if an office can be held by civilians, as the court of criminal appeals judgeship can be, it is still a military office if it's performing a military function. So judged by that standard, we think Petitioners' claim fails on that first instance because the Court of Military Commission Review is not a civil office. But even if you disagree with us on that question, we also think that Congress has authorized by law military officers to hold a position on the Court of Military Commission Review. And the way that my friend approaches Section 973 is through the lens of assigning and appointing, and he wants to draw a sharp distinction between assigning and appointment and read that distinction into the prohibition in Section 973.

The Court in Vallandigham went out of its way to explain why the military commission itself was not \"judicial\" in the sense of Article III. The analogy, of course, to this case would be to the underlying court-martial proceeding and not to the decisions by the courts of criminal appeals or by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Turning to the merits, I think it's important to stress the emptiness of the government's suggestion that it has been engaged in rigorous administrative enforcement of the statute. On its read-in of both Section 973(b)(5) and of the deletion of the automatic termination provision, there is, in fact, no consequence for violating a statute Congress enacted to ensure civilian control of the military, for protecting the civilians' fear of government from having military officers serving in all kinds of positions, and there would be no remedy, especially in a case like this one, where the problem at issue is not a general objection to military officers serving in administrative positions, but a very specific objection to military officers serving as judges. This Court has, for decades, suggested that there are unique separation of powers considerations and there are unique doctrinal and common law reasons to take especially seriously concerns that judges are acting without authority. It's why this Court in both the Ryder case and Nguyen held that the de facto officer doctrine does not apply to immunize at least non-technical violations of judicial assignment rules, and it's why the separation of powers problem we have identified is especially serious in this context. One last point, though, the -- neither -- the government doesn't talk about the -- did not talk about the Commander-in-Chief clause in its merits argument, but I think it's worth stressing just how serious a Commander-in-Chief clause problem a ruling in its favor could create. Under judges who are appointed to the Court of Military Commission Review, under Section 950f(b)(3), serve with good cause removal protection."}, {"start": 3869.855, "stop": 3933.49, "byte_start": 15509205, "byte_stop": 15763742, "text": "What that means is if they're military officers, they are insulated from removal by good cause, which, of course, takes them out of the chain of command. Now, rather than suggest that that is a constitutional constraint on the President as Commander-in-Chief, the government argues that, in fact, a judge who is appointed to the CMCR by the President and confirmed by the Senate can be reassigned by the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. There is no suggestion in the Military Commissions Act that Congress intended such a, frankly bizarre, reassignment scheme, and there's no explanation for how that would solve the Commander-in-Chief clause problem. We agree that that question is not squarely presented here because it would only invalidate the ability of these judges to serve on the Court of Military Commission Review. But given that there is a petition for writ of mandamus pending in the D.C. Circuit by two of the defendants in the 9/11 trial, we think it incumbent upon on this Court to reach the merits question and not just rely on the remedies consideration, even if it is inclined to affirm the decisions below.
