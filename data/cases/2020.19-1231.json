  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maintains a collection of rules governing ownership of broadcast media, intended to promote \u201ccompetition, diversity, and localism.\u201d In 1996, in response to sentiment that the rules were overly restrictive, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, of which Section 202(h) required the Commission to review the broadcast ownership rules on a regular basis. The FCC\u2019s performance of its duties under that section has been the subject of extensive litigation.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the FCC issued an order eliminating altogether newspaper/broadcast and television/radio cross-ownership rules, and making other substantial changes. It also announced its intention to adopt an incubator program, calling for comment on various aspects of the program. In August 2018, the FCC established a radio incubator program. Numerous parties filed petitions for review challenging various aspects of the FCC\u2019s order. Among them, Petitioner Prometheus Radio Project argued that the FCC did not adequately consider the effect its rule changes would have on ownership of broadcast media by women and racial minorities.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found that although the FCC did \u201costensibly\u201d consider this issue, its analysis was \u201cso insubstantial\u201d that it cannot provide a \u201creliable foundation\u201d for the FCC\u2019s conclusions. As such, the Third Circuit vacated the bulk of the agency\u2019s actions over the past three years as arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n",
