That's kind of the big ticket issue as I see it here. And my concern about saying, oh, yeah, you can come in and get the benefit of the change in the career offender guideline is that what about the defendants who are in prison for armed robbery or what have you? They can't use 2255 or 3582 to come in and get the benefit of the change in the career offender guideline. So the people who are coming in for the crack/powder issue are being treated differently than those people in getting an extra benefit compared to those people by being able to take advantage of the change in the career offender guideline, even though it's not retroactive. That concerns me about the disparity. That also makes me think the \"as if\" language has some -- some bite here or at least it should. And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to all that."

On the question about disparity, I recognize there may be some difference in treatment between the covered offenders in this case and, for example, a powder offender, but I don't think that disparity is an unwarranted disparity, and that's because Congress has acted here in a very significant way to give a substantial benefit to the crack offender. So I -- I think, in a real sense, the powder defendant that you're talking about is not similarly situated to the crack defendant, who's covered by this law. I would also note that the powder defendant is probably out of jail at this point because the sentences that were given to the crack offenders were so substantially longer than sentences for any other kind of drug."

                "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 404 of the First Step Act authorizes a limited sentence reduction proceeding, not a plenary resentencing. By its plain terms, Section 404 only requires a district court to take account of one new development, namely, the changes to crack cocaine sentencing made by Sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act. Section 404 does not entitle a defendant to insist that the court consider other unrelated factual and legal developments since the original sentencing, including the more than 75 non-retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that the Commission has adopted since 2010. Reading Section 404 to create such an entitlement would result in a significant and unjustified windfall for a select subset of crack cocaine offenders who were sentenced before the effective date of the Fair Sentencing Act. Petitioner's principal argument, as you've heard this morning, in favor of such an entitlement rests on the term \"impose\" in Section 404, which Petitioner would read to incorporate a requirement to redo the Section 3553(a) analysis that a court does in imposing an initial sentence. That argument is inconsistent with the text of Section 404 as a whole, in particular, with the text of Section 404(c), as well as with the undisputedly limited scope and nature of sentence reduction proceedings. As the statutory text reflects, the lodestar of any proceeding under Section 404 is the defendant's existing lawful sentence. At every single proceeding under Section 404, the district court has already fully considered the Section 3553(a) factors at the original sentencing, and the only question before the court is whether to reduce that current sentence. In that context, we think that Congress chose to require district courts to consider only the changes made by Sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, and it sensibly left the consideration of other developments to the Court's discretion. I welcome the Court's questions."

First, the United States does not oppose consideration of the revised drug quantity table in the Section 404 proceedings. So, in that sense, the district courts are -- are permitted to and, indeed, are taking account of the Commission's handiwork here. The principal locus of a lot of the litigation about these proceedings is the career offender enhancement, which I think, as Justice Kavanaugh's questions demonstrated earlier, has nothing at all to do with the crack-to-powder disparity that Congress was addressing in the Fair Sentencing Act and in the First Step Act. The second point I'd like to make about the Commission's role here, Section 404 proceedings unfold under the aegis of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A)."

The First Step Act doesn't have that sort of limitation, and so we don't see any reason for courts not to be able to consider current law and current facts in First Step Act proceedings. Mr. Chief Justice, you asked a question about why we shouldn't just fix the one problem and leave it at that, and -- and the problem with that approach is that this is not a mechanical adjustment."
