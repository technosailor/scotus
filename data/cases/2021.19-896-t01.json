After six months of detention, without any independent review, he had not yet even received a hearing on his withholding claim, let alone a decision or subsequent appeals, at the end of which he might not be removed at all. Now, three years later, the government still seeks the power to imprison him, despite his significant family ties and lack of any criminal record, pending his modified yet still unadjudicated withholding of removal claim. Section 1231(a)(6), as definitively construed in Zadvydas, forecloses his unchecked prolonged detention."

But I think you would have to DIG the case, because it doesn't make sense to decide the logically downstream issue of bond hearings and all the procedural requirements that might go into that without deciding the logically antecedent question is, do they satisfy the main test of Zadvydas? There is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future for a client -- for someone like my client. You have to decide that first before deciding the downstream question about bond hearings. So, to answer your question directly, I think, if the Court is not inclined to decide that logically antecedent and, to me, a -- a slam-dunk inquiry, if the Court isn't inclined to decide that, then I think it should DIG both this case and the Aleman Gonzalez case because in neither case was this threshold issue litigated because of the unique posture of how those cases came to this Court."

Martinez says, no, it applies to all people who fall within 1231(a)(6) because it's a statutory -- it's a statutory construction. So what I'm asking you to do, Justice Kagan, what I'm asking this Court to do, is not revisit Zadvydas at all, not extend it at all, but apply the test that is set out in black and white at page 701 of Zadvydas. This is the core holding of Zadvydas: At the six-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the government must respond with evidence or release them subject to conditions of supervised release."
