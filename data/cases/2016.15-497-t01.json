Now, it seems to me, as the Chief Justice just said, that if we accept your first argument, not in all cases, but in many cases, where their lawyer wishes to avoid this exhaustion requirement, all he would have to do is wait and then sue, not for putting the child in a private school but rather for emotional suffering. Now, if that argument -- if what I have just said is right, which I think is what was just said by the Chief Justice, that would seem to gut the carefully written procedural system that the IDEA sets up.",

Zwickler and City of Lyons, the only way they can invoke Article III jurisdiction is by saying there is a reasonable prospect that the situation would occur. There is not a word in the complaint that says she won't return to the school, and indeed, the Sixth Circuit grapples with this all the time, when children leave the school and file these lawsuits. There is a case called Woods, which is at 487 Federal Appendix 979, and what that case says is, even if you leave the school, the school has an ongoing obligation to keep an IEP current in case the person comes back to the school. If you adopted, if the Federal district court granted their declaratory judgment, the only way they can do so, and the only way they can invoke Article III processes is by saying, look, there is a chance E.F. might come back.
