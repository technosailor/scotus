From even before the Twelfth Amendment, many states had laws removing or fining electors for violating the conditions of their appointment, repudiating a central premise of Petitioners' claim. And, second, as this Court recognized in Ray and in McPherson, from the very first presidential election, states have been choosing electors specifically because they had promised to support a particular presidential candidate. And this contradicts Petitioners' claim that the framers viewed the exercise of discretion as central to the elector role, and it shows that Petitioners' quarrel is not just with our long-standing practice; it is with the framers themselves."

Is that consistent with the Constitution's prescribed order of appointment, meaning in voting, it seems like the voting comes first and then the appointment under the uniform law, and is it also consistent with the federal Electoral Count Act?

And so they specifically prohibited members of Congress from serving in that role. But other -- but they left it to states to decide whether electors would serve as kind of -- you know, as Hamilton envisioned them, as the kind of sage chooser on behalf of the states or, as many other framers wanted, the electors to be agents of the people, to -- to -- to act on the people's behalf and for the people to choose them and for them to be bound to that outcome, to be bound to the people's preference.
