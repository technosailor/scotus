And it's true that there's a separate provision for securities disgorgements in the bankruptcy laws, but that doesn't apply to the disgorgements under other statutes, such as the statute in which the government previously took the position in this Court that disgorgement was a fine, penalty, or forfeiture.

And now in this Court, when we point out those positions, the SEC says, well, it's sometimes compensatory, sometimes isn't, but the fact that merely sometimes we're compensating people, that's enough to make it compensatory enough to fall outside of Section 2462.

We look at the Maillard case involving a value customs forfeiture quite similar to this case in which, again, the judge at the time -- it was a district court -- refused to apply that canon because of the -- the court's view that it shouldn't apply in these backwards-looking remedies. And in fact, the Gabelli case itself I believe is quite strong for us on this, because in that case, if there was some pro-government canon, it wouldn't treat -- the court wouldn't treat the government worse off than private plaintiffs.
