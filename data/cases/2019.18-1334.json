  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large part due to its ambiguous legal status as a protectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental policies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico\u2019s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.</p>\n<p>A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama\u2019s authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress\u2019s plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d because: (1) they occupy \u201ccontinuing positions,\u201d (2) exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d and (3) exercise their authority \u201cpursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d Moreover, these officers are \u201cprincipal\u201d officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</p>\n",
  "question": "<ol><li>Does the Appointments Clause govern the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico?</li>\n<li>Does the de facto officer doctrine allows courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?</li>\n</ol>",
