The real fight here is substantive, over how much discretion the President has. Text, history, and precedent are all clear about the general test whether one is an inhabitant. The question is how to apply that test to people who are present in the country illegally. Treating someone apprehended at the border on March 31 or scheduled to be removed on April 2 as a usual or settled resident of the United States on April 1 flies in the face of this Court's cases, common sense, and any sound theory of political representation. The President has at least some discretion to determine that at least some illegal aliens lack enduring ties to the states, which means that the judgment should be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions."
