A paragraph in Montgomery about formal fact-finding has created confusion, but it cannot mean that no determination of permanent incorrigibility whatsoever is required because that would obliterate the crux of the decision. Any rule of law requires deciding if the defendant fits within the rule. But Mississippi's courts have denied the permanent incorrigibility rule itself, and the State continues that denial in this Court. In remanding this very case for resentencing, the Mississippi Supreme Court did not say a word about the permanent incorrigibility rule and affirmatively misinterpreted the law by stating that LWOP is unconstitutional if and only if the sentencing judge does not consider youth-related circumstances. On remand, the sentencing judge made clear he was weighing aggravators and mitigators, not assessing permanent incorrigibility."

The other option that the Court has is to say that there's an implicit finding rule, that, ordinarily, you presume that the judge understands the law, understands the permanent incorrigibility rule, and that the life-without-parole sentence reflects a determination that the defendant is permanently incorrigible. But that presumption doesn't apply here because of the affirmative misstatements that I've alluded to. And either way, the Court could make it clear that there's plenty of room for State experimentation and innovation as to the procedure, as to who bears the burden, what is the standard of proof, what is the standard of review, et cetera."

But suppose you think that that's an aggressive reading of Miller, that there -- that although you said, you know, on page 479 Miller says this, that that wasn't really the thrust of Miller, and, in fact, Montgomery, you know, read it quite aggressively and that there's a gap between the two. If -- if that's right -- I mean, you can first tell me whether you think that's right, but, if it's right, which opinion should we look to and why?"

Brett never really had a chance to show that he wasn't permanently incorrigible in any kind of meaningful way because the court had been told that it doesn't need to resolve that question against him in order to sentence him to life without parole. And to allow the permanent incorrigibility rule to be flouted is to discard Miller and Montgomery and to undermine stare decisis and the interest in stability that it protects."

And I think, if you really look at Petitioner's reply brief on pages 12 -- or pages 11 and 12, I think it underscores the absence of any constitutional mooring for the rule that the Petitioner advances, because he doesn't really tell us is this a legal rule or a factual rule. Which side would have the burden of proof? Does a judge or jury have to make the finding? If it -- if it is a specific finding, does a jury have to make it? And at that point, are we in the Apprendi arena? So I think that that just suggests that we don't really know what the nature of the rule is, which suggests that it's probably not a constitutional rule."

This Court should reaffirm that conclusion for two reasons. First, whether a crime reflects transient immaturity isn't an inquiry separate from the inquiry Miller prescribes. Under Miller, the court must consider whether the distinctive attributes of youth have diminished the penological justifications for life without parole. When, as in this case, the court determines that they have not, that is a determination that the crime does not reflect transient immaturity, and no further finding is required. Second, even if transient immaturity required a separate finding, the court made such a finding here when it found Petitioner's transient immaturity argument unpersuasive. For either of those reasons, the judgment below should be affirmed."

I think it would help the analysis if the Court were to make clear that the phrase \"crime reflecting transient immaturity\" means a crime where the penological justification for a life-without-parole sentence has collapsed in one of the distinctive attributes of youth, and a \"crime reflecting permanent incorrigibility\" is a crime where those penological justifications have not collapsed. That would have the benefit of lining up the language in Montgomery with the inquiry Miller prescribes, but it would also have the benefit of allowing sentencing courts to conduct this inquiry the way they usually do, which is to consider the penological justification in light of a certain category of mitigating evidence and to ask whether that mitigating evidence is sufficiently compelling in a particular case."
