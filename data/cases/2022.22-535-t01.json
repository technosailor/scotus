By raising this procedural argument, though, they're effectively asking for an opportunity to raise the very same substantive claim that they lack standing to pursue through the guise of a procedural challenge to the Act. And there is no apparent reason for the Court to allow that kind of gambit and to take what is actually a substantive challenge based on a generalized grievance with how the executive is administering the law and alter the ordinary Article III standards to allow a plaintiff to revisit that conclusion through a procedural mechanism."

And I guess I wonder, is that about COVID, or is that just about something that happens when you excuse loan payments for a long period of time and how it is that that gets to be converted into an emergency COVID rationale? And then, on the economic considerations, and I think it was Justice Barrett who talked about this a little, it seems, you know, a real mixture of COVID and non-COVID-related things. And, of course, this is how the economy works, that COVID interacts with other features of the economy to produce certain economic conditions, but, again, I'm wondering whether, you know, there was more of an obligation on the part of the Secretary to isolate how COVID was affecting these borrowers?"

Instead, the Secretary analyzed the historical data regarding forbearance as a data point in understanding that forbearance is not always a complete solution to the underlying economic harm caused by the national emergency. So, here, there's no doubt that forbearance has provided very powerful and critical support to borrowers over the life of the COVID pandemic, but the Secretary found that once forbearance policy lifts, millions and millions of borrowers are going to be worse off with respect to their ability to pay because of The forbearance policy hasn't fixed the underlying economic harm of the -- of the pandemic and the emergency."

And so I think it's not surprising to see in response to this once-in-a-century pandemic the kind of relief that the Secretaries have offered here, the forbearance policy that has itself cost $150 billion and now this loan forgiveness program. To the extent that you have concerns about the scope and size of the program, though, I would say that if I can get you to agree with me, and maybe I can't, on this point that the categorical debt discharge argument doesn't work as a statutory matter, then I think the right place to look to house those concerns is in arbitrary and capricious review. We think here that the Secretary drew reasonable lines in crafting the scope of relief, but if you disagree or if you think he should have taken different interests into account, that would be a basis to reverse him on arbitrary and capricious grounds, not to distort the plain meaning of the HEROES Act."

It would actually be perverse to suggest that when there's a big emergency that might necessitate broader relief, the Secretary's more disabled from acting. Instead, that's the language in the statute that's meant to empower the Secretary and to ensure that he has whatever tools are necessary to fulfill the statutory purpose, to ensure that borrowers are not left worse off. With respect to these concerns about whether there's room to take into account other interests beyond student-loan borrowers, you know, there are avenues to go to Congress for additional relief, to implement other programs. There's been unprecedented levels of COVID pandemic aid, as I mentioned, and I think to suggest that the Secretary here should have told borrowers who he had determined were at massive risk of default and delinquency in record numbers that he wasn't going to use the authority under the HEROES Act that's tailor-made to prevent that result would have been an irresponsible thing to do. So, again, I think that this really comes down to Congress's judgment that there should be authority to provide the benefit within the context of this program."

Go back to the cases he cited which involved environmental plaintiffs, and imagine a scenario where you have an environmental plaintiff who is interested in pollution, and the agency has decided to regulate water pollution. Now that plaintiff doesn't actually have a stake in water pollution, isn't harmed by it, but the plaintiff thinks that if it can hold up the agency from regulating water pollution, maybe the next priority or goal will be to go after air pollution. I think that if a plaintiff came to court and pressed that kind of claim, it would be clear that it is far too attenuated and can't possibly supply a basis to allow this universe of plaintiffs to newly assert these kinds of procedural injuries or substantive injuries with respect to agency decisions that have not been made. He said that they have a concrete interest in trying to have their debts forgiven. If that were their interest, there were several straightforward mechanisms to try to vindicate it here. They could have challenged this plan as being arbitrary and capricious on substantive grounds to say you should expand the plan to include us, or if for some reason they really wanted to have this under the Education Act, they could have gone to the Secretary and filed a petition for rulemaking and said give us relief under the Education Act. But, instead, their argument here is that the Secretary can't provide debt relief. That is a really anomalous way to try to vindicate an interest that they claim they have in loan forgiveness. I've been thinking of it effectively as this Rube Goldberg theory of standing where instead of taking the most direct route, you've set up this complicated route to try to get what you want, all in service of being able to smuggle in a substantive challenge to the HEROES Act for borrowers who are not hurt one bit by the Secretary's decision to grant relief under that Act. Finally, I want to respond to his suggestion that instead the Secretary should have proceeded under the Higher Education Act here. I would think that at the very least, if they were going to ask this Court to recognize a cognizable Article III injury on that basis, it would be incumbent on them to explain their wholly unexplained position of why they think the Secretary could do this under the Higher Education Act. My friend has suggested that that's what this program was actually designed to do. But this is a pandemic-related program."
