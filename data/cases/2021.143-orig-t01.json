And I think the danger there is -- is what we're already seeing here, where you have both Mississippi and Tennessee pumping on each side of the border, trying to have a tug of war over this groundwater at issue, unnaturally draining the aquifer and damaging it when -- if, based on the nature of groundwater, if both states pumped away from the border, neither state would have any impact whatsoever on the groundwater within the -- the neighboring state.

First, the Equitable Apportionment Doctrine provides the exclusive remedy for complaints about the usage of water that flows from one state into another and the actions in one state affect interstate water flow. Mississippi's claim for more than $600 million in damages, therefore, must be dismissed. Mississippi's principal argument in response is that the aquifer water flows slowly. But this Court has never conditioned the application of the Equitable Apportionment Doctrine on water velocity. Here, even Mississippi's expert acknowledged that in predevelopment conditions, more than 37 million gallons of water per day flowed out of Mississippi and into adjoining states. Second, the Master did not consider how this case would fundamentally change if Mississippi were freely allowed to amend to plead an equitable apportionment action at this stage after disavowing an apportionment claim for the last decade. Nor did the Master consider that Mississippi can show no injury at all from Tennessee's water withdrawals."

You've held that in other cases involving compacts, where you've enforced compact decrees for surface flows notwithstanding the fact that there have been substantial water pumping going on on either side of the state. And so I think that it's not that far of an extension to say that where Mississippi has uniquely pleaded a claim about an aquifer that all the evidence showed at trial was connected to surface streams, and, here, the Wolf River, itself an interstate river, flows directly into the Middle Claiborne Aquifer at a recharge zone in the eastern part of the area that we're talking about."

When those characteristics exist, you're inevitably going to have a conflict of sovereign interests of, on the one hand, the sovereign interest of the state's right to use the water here in Tennessee and, of course, the sovereign -- the interests of the other sovereign to protect its citizens from whatever effects that use may have. And because one state can't simply impose its policy on the other, the Doctrine of Equitable Apportionment does what the best we can do, which is to treat each state as an equal sovereign, take account of all their interests, put both states' bound -- both states' interests on the balance, and then reconcile them as best as we can."
