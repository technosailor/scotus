DHS is engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking that the states will be free to participate in to make a new Public Charge Rule.

That's the sort of interest that I take them to be trying to vindicate with this Munsingwear argument, and that's just never been recognized as the sort of thing that justifies intervention as of right."

And if DHS had made the decision that it wanted to engage in new rulemaking and replace the rule and if it was clear that the rule wasn't having its intended effect, it would be very unusual for the government to come to this Court and ask it to grant certiorari. Now, here, those changes, those facts came to light after the petitions had been filed, and the decision was made after cert had been granted, but it's the same sort of decision not to ask this Court to review an adverse decision of the government."

I think that, you know, relieves them of some of their concerns and doesn't create the problems that we have about forcing the government to continue litigating about this rule that it's simultaneously trying to replace, which was really a big part of the concern that we had when we were approaching what to do about this litigation."

We can all agree that the government has the ability to acquiesce -- acquiesce in a judgment in its favor.

I'm not aware of an extension of Munsingwear that has been sort of applied in this circumstance for non-parties to intervene in a moot case to seek vacatur, but even if it were theoretically possible, that still raises the Rule 24 question, which is, what practical stake or what stake has Arizona identified to seek vacatur in these circumstances?

After intervention, they would still have to secure modification of the final vacatur judgment and then rescission of the rescission rule before the rule could spring back to life and there could be any meaningful litigation in the Ninth Circuit.
