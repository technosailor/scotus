The court of appeals nonetheless found that Longoni's testimony was permissible, and it did so applying the legal fiction that an expert may state the basis for his underlying conclusions and opinions under Rule 703 without offering that basis for the truth.

So I think I hear you saying that when an expert testifies in general about, as -- as Justice Gorsuch said, you know, industry standard, this is the way this kind of testing is ordinarily done, this is from my own personal knowledge how the methodology is typically taken care of in these situations, that that could be okay and no Confrontation Clause problem but that the problem arises, I guess in this case, when the expert's testimony actually relies on the statements in this lab report about what was done to this evidence and sort of vouches for that, right? When the expert says not this is the way things are normally tested and I'm telling you that from my expert view, but in this particular case, the evidence that was collected was tested in a certain way, I'm assuming that that's actually true and now my testimony is X on the basis of that assumption. Is it the government's view that that is not being offered for truth or it is in the latter scenario?"

I mean, I'm just looking -- I'm just going to read you some places where the witness really couldn't seem to answer questions without, you know, reviewing the report. So there's a question: Did your review help show how State's Exhibit 26 was tested in this case? And Longoni says: May I review the report, Your Honor? The court says: You may.

But the strength of their case, as been -- as has been noted, is not a confrontation issue, and it doesn't raise a confrontation violation. The reason that the State recognized that it needed to introduce Rast's statements into the record through Longoni is that it strengthened their case, and that in a nutshell underscores why her statements were being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. One other point I'd like to address, which is this notion of a limiting instruction. My friend at the State indicated that several times that Smith did not request a limiting instruction. It bears emphasis that you get to the -- the -- the notion of a limiting instruction only after you have a legitimate non-hearsay purpose for admitting the statements in the first place."
