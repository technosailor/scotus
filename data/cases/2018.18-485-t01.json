Think about Wallace because, in Wallace, the Court said there is daylight and the reason for that is it cited Section 187 of the Wood treatise, and that very sentence it cited said, yes, there's daylight not just for the false imprisonment claim that was at issue in Wallace but also for malicious prosecution. It's the same sentence, and it makes particular sense here because the reason for malicious prosecution's favorable termination requirement is not really that it's an element of the offense but, rather, that it voids all of the policy concerns that -- that -- that we talk about in our briefs. So, if you look at Keyton's treatise at page -- this is cited in our reply brief at page 8, it says the following: \"The requirement of termination is probably a matter of ripeness, a belief that malicious prosecution actions should not be tried at a time when they try to chill testimony."

And the second point, most notably, contrary, Justice Gorsuch, to the premise of your question, it's quite remarkable to actually have the federal government agreeing with this former criminal defendant on this issue and saying the policy concerns -- as Justice Kavanaugh says, the orderly and practical policy concerns are ones that say that a favorable termination rule, at least at a minimum, should be imported as a limitations rule. That would safeguard the policy concerns, all the different policy concerns that the favorable termination requirement has had at common law, and you then leave for another day the further question, is it an absolutely mandatory element on the merits?
