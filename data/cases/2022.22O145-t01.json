That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\" However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for four separate reasons."

And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text, structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future."

Because issuers of certain financial instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states. Just two years later, Congress responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase. Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA. To justify that, it argues that the FDA doesn't cover instruments that function precisely like other money orders but are marketed differently."

So it's hardly surprising that all three payment systems experts in this case, including Delaware's own expert, agreed that under any ordinary understanding of the phrase \"third-party bank check,\" MoneyGram official checks are not third-party bank checks. So we would ask this Court to overrule the exceptions and adopt the Special Master's recommendation."

                "text": "I think this is one of the reasons why we're judging things sort of on a class of instruments, and as a class of instruments in contrast to official checks and money orders, these are not always prepaid, so that it's a class-wide distinction. But, even aside from that, there are other reasons why we believe that cashier's checks, even aside from our definition, would not be swept in under the term \"money order.\" And one of those reasons is I think, as, Justice Thomas, your question reflects, you know, there are instruments in the world that people would not describe as money orders even if they share some of the common core features, and a cashier's check is a good example of that. We would not in ordinary parlance call a cashier's check a money order because it is a unique instrument in that it's issued by the same bank, drawn on that same bank, which makes it a uniquely secure instrument that is different. So, in ordinary English, it's a well-known instrument, as Delaware agrees, as the American Bankers Association agrees, and that's a justification for carving it out. And then, finally, another reason why we would think it wouldn't be covered is because, in 2501, when Congress is describing money orders as a class of instruments, it describes them as a class of instruments for which addresses are not ordinarily kept as a business practice. That does not describe cashier's checks in 1974 and it doesn't describe them today."

Instead, it's MoneyGram that has the money, and it's MoneyGram that is responsible for paying the drawee bank or for reporting the unclaimed property. The other definition of bank check that you've been given is a broader definition than that, and it's the -- the definition that Brady's Law of Bank Checks, which is again reproduced in Delaware's appendix, gives for bank checks where it describes a bank check as both those -- that technical definition that I just mentioned but also ordinary checks. In -- in the 1970s going all the way back until World War I, bank check had been used as a terminology -- used as a term under Brady's Law of Bank Checks to both mean those -- those specific instruments issued by banks but also ordinary checks, and that's part of why a third-party bank check ultimately, what that phrase means if we're in the similar written instrument provision, is an ordinary check."
