The First Circuit recognized that Maine cannot discriminate against students or schools because they are religious, but it held the state is perfectly free to discriminate against students or schools because they do religious things, such as teach or receive instruction in religion. The First Circuit was wrong. Religious discrimination is religious discrimination, and unless it can survive strict scrutiny, it is unconstitutional. The First Circuit's refusal to apply strict scrutiny based on a supposed status use distinction was baseless."

The First Circuit correctly held that whether or not these two particular schools ultimately will or will not participate was beside the point because the constitutional injury here is the denial of the opportunity to even seek out religious education under this program. That constitutional injury is directly attributable to the sectarian exclusion, and it is unquestionable that holding the sectarian exclusion unconstitutional would redress that injury. And this Court's decisions in cases such as Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors, Heckler Mat -- versus Mathews make clear that when a plaintiff is challenging the -- a barrier, a discriminatory barrier to a public benefit, the plaintiff need not show, indeed, need not even allege, that they would actually obtain the benefit but for the discriminatory provision. In fact, in Heckler versus Mathews, it was a foregone conclusion that if the plaintiffs -- plaintiff was successful in challenging the discriminatory provision in the public benefit program, he would not get the benefit because there was a unique severability provision in the program that said if this provision is invalidated the benefit goes away."

And -- but, after Zelman was decided in 2003, the Maine legislature reexamined the question, decided to maintain the bar in effect on the books based on independent reasons. But, to -- to speak to the strife point in particular, I think it is likely, contrary to what was said earlier, that allowing the subsidy for religious schools will tend to favor -- favor majoritarian religions because, in order to have a religious school, you don't have -- you have to have more than a single adherent to a particular belief system."
