Petitioner flips the rule on its head. It argues that by making certain costs taxable in the district court, the rule confines the court of appeals to only deciding which party may be taxed costs, while empowering the recently reversed district court to decide the fairness of awarding all, some, or none of those appellate costs. Apart from the text, longstanding precedent before Rule 39 refutes that position. This history confirms two things: First, a general appellate award of costs means all covered costs, and, second, a district court assigned to tax appellate costs has no power to revisit the equities or award less than full costs. This case shows the problems with Petitioner's approach."

So I gather that you're not really denying that the district court, through 1924, has some authority to reduce when it reviews the costs for excessive copying, et cetera, but just that in this particular case of the supersedeas bond, that it doesn't have the authority to reduce it because the time for that particular cost has come and gone. So you see what I'm saying, that this is maybe a dispute about supersedeas bonds and not more generally about the district court's authority to take into account whether costs are necessarily incurred?

If a cost is improper or unfair, there's simply no obvious way to get back to the circuit after the mandate has issued without engaging in burdensome motions to withdraw the mandate, which are exceedingly rare and are generally a waste of time when district courts can resolve these disputes perfectly well in the first instance. There's simply no reason to shoehorn cost issues into other appellate procedures that just simply are not obviously designed to handle them. Even if the appellate court can make adjustments to the overall percentage, like saying in this case we'll award two-thirds of a party's costs, which I do think is still unusual, a district court still has to exercise discretion over those taxable costs.
