And I think, in this definition of \"debt collector,\" Congress sets up a contradistinction between, on the one hand, an entity whose principal purpose, and it has to be the principal purpose, is the collection of debts, and an entity whose principal purpose, again, the principal purpose, is the enforcement of security interests. And, again, that's another textual cue that suggests that this is an either/or proposition, that Congress thought -- again, whatever the meaning of \"debt collection\" in the abstract -- that these were distinct concepts. After all, if you take a look at the earlier bills, which we quote, I think, at page 25 of our brief, Congress uses that distinction throughout all of these bills."
