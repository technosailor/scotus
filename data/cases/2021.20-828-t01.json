If I'm hearing you right, your arguments, you say that if a party has standing -- and very few have standing because very few people know they've been surveilled in the way these plaintiffs do. I've had research done, and the only plaintiffs that have standing that I found where a court has found standing to bring an 1810 claim is the Fourth Circuit case. So -- but I think what you're saying to me is, if those -- these plaintiffs, who appear to have reasonable grounds to believe they were surveilled, so they have standing, that they can't proceed if you claim state secrets. They can't have a judge look at this evidence to determine whether it was lawful or unlawful because you say, if a judge says it's unlawful, and I don't know how, because if a judge says it's unlawful, how are you injured? All they have to do after that is prove their damages."

And, first, we're going to decide what kind of evidence should be excluded, and then we're going to decide based on the -- the full evidence of the case whether the suit can go forward or not in all fairness to the parties.

First, Section 1806(f) provides only a narrow mechanism for deciding the admissibility and discoverability of surveillance materials. It does not speak at all to the fact that the government's assertion of the state secrets privilege deprives the individual defendants of a valid defense, a defense that depends not on the surveillance evidence that would be at issue in a FISA proceeding but on the privileged information about the targets, predicates, and scope of the investigation. Second, adjudicating the individual defendants' liability in camera and ex parte with no jury and no right to participate would violate the Seventh Amendment and Due Process Clause. Even if the court of appeals' interpretation were plausible, FISA does not compel it, and this Court should reject a reading that raises those grave concerns. I welcome the Court's questions."

And I think it's undisputed that that would violate the individual defendants' jury trial rights and due process rights. Now Mr. Kneedler, I think, has made some good points that we agree with about the language of 1806(f) regarding what a use is and what a -- what a covered motion or request is. But I think there's a -- just a broader point to make about that statute, and that is that the FISA, both 1806(f) and, frankly, an 1810 claim, are completely orthogonal to what is at issue in the First Amendment and equal protection claims and the defenses that are necessary to those claims. As has been discussed, the result of an 1806(f) procedure is limited to suppression or admission of the fruits of the surveillance, so the recordings, and potentially disclosure to the aggrieved party of the application, materials, and court orders. None of that enables revelation of or certainly not disclosure to my clients or the ability to adjudicate the merits and defenses of the religious discrimination claims, which, as I said, don't turn on the surveillance evidence. They turn on who was or was not a target of investigation, why were they under investigation, what were the motivations and predicates, and what was the degree of fit between the methods used and legitimate counterterrorism goals, what were my clients' individual motivations. Those are all classic jury questions. They are questions that are completely subject to the privilege, as Judge Carney found, and they -- they cannot come out, even in a limited FISA proceeding, even if we thought that 1806 was available."

The -- the privilege here, as Mr. Kneedler indicated, was properly asserted, and the -- the court of appeals did not dispute that. In -- in making that determination, the district court -- and he says he paid especially close attention to the classified materials, which the district court described as providing comprehensive and detailed information, informing the court as to the sensitive and privileged facts. And Judge Carney concluded from that classified material that it provided essential evidence to showing \"that the purported dragnet investigations were not indiscriminate schemes to target Muslims but were properly predicated and focused.\" That is the information that the individual defendants need to be able to defend themselves. And this Court recognized in General Dynamics, as the lower courts have uniformly recognized, that it would be manifestly unfair to allow claims to go on in that situation where the government's assertion of the privilege prevents an individual capacity defendant from putting forward a defense that depends on that privileged information, which, again, even if there were some reason -- reading of FISA that would allow a limited proceeding in camera to determine the lawfulness of the proceeding under FISA, that has nothing to do with the privileged information and is not a mechanism for bringing it out or allowing my clients to rely on it. Just a -- a couple of quick points on the text of 1806(f)."

But, when they then go further and say we don't just want the common law traditional rule, we want to now dismiss the religion claims, even though you can make your case with your own evidence, that transforms it from just keeping it excluded into an affirmative use. They're using it to effectuate the dismissal of the religion claims. So, at that point, it becomes a use. And that's why I think it's also relevant that the Ninth Circuit -- the decision below only -- they said they only are finding it displaced with respect to the dismissal remedy. And -- and that's, I think, important because it's -- it's when they move to dismiss that it becomes a use and isn't merely exclusion of the information at issue."

You know, that -- that, I think, is the critical reason why, because of that last part, it is an affirmance. Now that being said -- and I still want to come back to the other parts of your question, Justice Breyer -- we only have to win that it's a basis for -- an alternative basis for affirmance if it's not in the question presented, right? I mean, if it's in the question, because you can't determine if FISA displaces the state secrets privilege without knowing what the state secrets privilege does, then it seems to me that the Court can address it that way as well.

Now that standard, the attorney general files a declaration that disclosure would harm national security, is almost identical to the standard in Reynolds that divulging the information could risk endangering national security. Substantively, the substantive rule is almost identical."

They can move to dismiss under state secrets privilege, which is what they've done, or they can go through 1806(f) and give the information ex parte and in camera to the court even though the statute says these are the procedures that shall be applied, notwithstanding any other law, whenever these conditions are met. And so that is a powerful displacement effect not for the state secrets privilege in general but for the state secrets privilege as applied to cases involving the domestic electronic surveillance of Americans. And that's all that's at issue in this case, is just about giving the district court ex parte in camera review, not -- not evidence, not -- not disclosure to us, because the decision below says they can reassert the privilege if there's a disclosure to us. But just that -- that aspect, the ex parte in camera review for cases involving domestic electronic surveillance, on that aspect, 1806(f) occupies the field."

And according to 1806, that matters with respect to whether the government can use it in the standard way that illegal evidence can't be used in a proceeding, and, for whatever reason, Congress thought it also mattered with respect to discovery requests on the part of, let's say, a plaintiff. And -- and that's a very different focus, you know, is -- was this -- was this obtained illegally, because we think that that question has something to do with whether we -- it should be discoverable or whether it should be usable in court from the normal state secrets inquiry, which is, you know, illegal, legal, who cares?

And so the fact that they are saying, oh, look, FISA is not displaced and, yes, allow us to dismiss claims, that -- that doesn't make any sense because, if you're going to say, okay, freeze the world and -- and operate as it existed in 1978, then you can't be giving them a dismissal remedy. I don't know if that -- that satisfactorily answers your question, but, yeah, that -- that's my -- that's my view on that subject. I also think that if the Court thinks that the state secrets question is not within the question presented, if that's -- if that's the Court's view, then -- but -- but the Court also thinks that the district court can, you know, proceed on the state secrets question, I'm not sure there's a rationale for answering either one, to be perfectly honest with you, but, yeah, that's my -- that's my view on that."

I agree with you there would be real doubts about whether the executive's power, Article II power, to conduct domestic surveillance would be exclusive and preclusive under Category 3 of the Jackson framework, so I -- I agree that would be doubtful in my view, although we haven't said that. But, at a minimum, I think the government is saying, in this separation of powers back and forth between the executive and Congress, what the executive is due is that Congress speak clearly, directly, give some clearer indication of an intent to intrude on the state secrets privilege than we have here. And the Chief Justice's questions about a few words and Justice Alito's questions, which I would certainly second, the district court -- that this kind of information, depending on what it is, is not the kind of information you want floating around even in the White House to people, much less floating around the country, depending on what it is, of course. So, on that question, that Article II influences the reading is kind of what I'm getting at with Article II, not the exclusive/preclusive."
