Second, as the complaint concedes, the defendants \"had no intent to aid ISIS's terrorist activities.\" Quite to the contrary, they maintained and regularly enforced policies prohibiting content that promotes terrorist activity. The plaintiff's claim that because defendants were generally aware that among their billions of users were ISIS adherents who violated their policies and, therefore, defendants should have done more to enforce those policies does not constitute aiding and abetting an act of international terrorism under the operative terms of the text, the constitutional principles articulated in Halberstam, or any recognized understanding of what it means to abet a criminal act. If Congress had wanted to impose treble damage liability for existing -- assisting a terrorist organization, it had a ready model in the material support statute, Section 2339B."

What Halberstam was using the term to do was to characterize a factual characterization of a series of property crimes in which it held that Bernard Welch and Linda Hamilton played \"symbiotic roles.\" It was not announcing a legal standard that encompasses a broad entity that provides general services to billions of people subject to an unequivocal enforced policy against terrorism. So even if I agree with you that you can establish substantial assistance to the principal tort by showing that there was a course of -- you know, a series of like acts of international terrorism or burglaries or property crimes in which the aider and abettor was, to quote the -- the D.C. Circuit, \"a willing participant\" and, therefore, aided and abetted the -- the principal tort, which was the burglary of the Halberstam home, I don't have a problem with that."

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist act that caused Mr. Alassaf's death and sympathizes with the profound loss that the plaintiffs in this case have experienced. We submit, however, that the allegations in this complaint do not state a claim that the defendants aided and abetted, that is, that they assumed a culpable role in the commission of that murder. JASTA requires more than allegations that a terrorist organization availed itself of interactive computer services that were remote from the act of terrorism, were widely and routinely available to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of persons through the automatic features of those services, and did not single out ISIS for favorable treatment. JASTA permits recovery against persons who become complicit by rendering substantial assistance that encourages the commission of terrorist acts, but by JASTA's express terms and its incorporation of Halberstam's common law standards, Congress ensured that JASTA does not reach so broadly as to inhibit legitimate and important activities by businesses, charities, and others, both in the United States and in other parts of the world that may be unstable or underdeveloped. I welcome the Court's questions."

So that, conceivably, if you separated out the clauses, aiding and abetting the person who committed such an act, it's almost like Justice Kavanaugh's materiality statute in the sense that you could, I guess, aid and abet a person who committed the act even if it's not with respect to that act, because that's not what the statute seems to say.

We're advancing a different argument, and I think this is the thrust of where your -- your concern is -- is directed, which is that if our claim is based on providing generalized assistance to the terrorist enterprise, where does that end? And let me say that that's not a question that arises merely under our standard. It arises under the government's standard because the government's formula on page 34 includes channeling, directly channeling, substantial amounts of money to ISIS, and the exact same problem would arise there. We think that the appropriate way of addressing that situation is to understand the remoteness issue in -- standard in Halberstam to refer not merely to remoteness in -- in space but to remoteness in time, and that would have been true in -- in the Halberstam case. If -- if there came a point when Hamilton stopped doing the books, let's say, Quicken came along and Welch wasn't using her assistance anymore, there would come a point when it had been too long since she was playing much of a role and she would no longer be liable. So we -- we would -- we would suggest that the standard include remoteness in time, weighed together with the volume of activity, and that -- that would address that problem. And we would suggest, if you use some variant of the government's standard, you -- you include that there as well because it presents the same problem."
