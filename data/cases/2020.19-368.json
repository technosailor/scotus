  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2015, Markkaya Jean Gullett, a Montana resident, was driving a Ford Explorer on a Montana highway when the tread on one of her tires separated. She lost control of the vehicle and died as a result of the vehicle rolling into a ditch.</p>\n<p>The personal representative of Gullett\u2019s estate sued Ford Motor Co. in Montana state court, alleging design-defect, failure-to-warn, and negligence claims. Ford moved to dismiss the claims for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>For a state court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the Due Process Clause requires that the court have either general personal jurisdiction or specific personal jurisdiction. A court has general personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant if the defendant\u2019s headquarters are within the state or if it is incorporated in the state. A court has specific personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant if the plaintiff\u2019s claims \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d the defendant\u2019s activities within the state.</p>\n<p>Ford Motor Co. has its headquarters in Michigan and is incorporated in Delaware. Ford assembled the vehicle in Kentucky and first sold it to a dealership in Washington State. The dealership then sold it to an Oregon resident, who later sold the vehicle to a purchaser who brought it to Montana.</p>\n<p>The district court denied Ford\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding a \u201cconnection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.\u201d The Montana Supreme Court affirmed, reasoning that by advertising and selling parts within the state of Montana, Ford had availed itself of the privilege of doing business in that state and was therefore subject to specific jurisdiction there.</p>\n<p>This case is consolidated with <em>Ford Motor Company v. Bandemer</em>, No. 19-369, which arises in Minnesota but presents the same legal question.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>May a state court, consistent with the Due Process Clause, exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant when none of the defendant\u2019s contacts with that state caused the plaintiff\u2019s claims?</p>\n",
