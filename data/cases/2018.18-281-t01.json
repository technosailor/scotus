                "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the Virginia House of Delegates formulated a redistricting plan that garnered overwhelming bipartisan support and swift preclearance by the Justice Department. That plan has governed the first four election cycles of the decade and delivered on its promise to provide African American voters with the ability to elect their candidates of choice in 12 districts that everybody agreed should be majority-minority districts. The basic choice for this Court will be whether that plan, duly enacted by the people of Virginia, will govern this last election of the decade or if, instead, there will be a court-imposed plan formulated by a special master from out of state. Now the Virginia attorney general, for his part, would impose the court-ordered plan on the people of Virginia on the theory that the House of Delegates lacks appellate standing to appeal. That argument is deeply flawed and has enormous consequences that go well beyond this case but would be a particularly problematic feature in the all-too-often context where there is an impasse between the legislative branch and the executive branch and there has to be a court-ordered plan and the legislative branch and the executive branch are often adverse in that litigation over the court-ordered plan."

But the second thing that I think would be more limited to these redistricting cases, and I think it's very important, is when you have a context where the court has gone out of its way to say that it's particularly important to credit the good faith of the legislatures engaged in a very difficult task, I think you need a heightened standard before you dismiss their testimony across the board. And what you have in this case, I think, is a perfect illustration of it."

But even more importantly, they all have the same basic problem when the legislature's confronting this district -- these districts, which is everybody I think agrees that these districts performed very differently in off-year House of Delegate elections than in presidential elections. So you can -- yeah, you can have the district-specific information about how many people voted for President Obama in these districts, but I think everybody really agrees that what you really need is to look at the off-year elections, because there's much less turnout, and that's where you have a problem with more racially polarized voting. Now, in those off-year elections, the single-most important data point would be a contested primary, because, especially in districts that are going to be relatively democratic where you really figure out whether or not the African American voters get to vote for their candidate of choice is in a contested primary, because that's when you have an African American candidate of choice going head-to-head with a white Democrat.

So it's not like they didn't have testimony at the time from members of the African American caucus that said they were right to apply these numbers across districts. I will reserve my time."
