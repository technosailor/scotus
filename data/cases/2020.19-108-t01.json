And I don't think we could perceive that in the context of the military for two reasons: one, Congress has repeatedly authorized it by statute, and many Presidents have allowed it, so it's hard to see the sort of national consensus that the Court perceived in Coker and Kennedy. And the other is just that I think the goals of the criminal law, which the Court talked about in those cases, things like deterrence and retribution, are served very differently in the military because of the military environment, the need to maintain trust and discipline, the need to achieve institutional equality, the need not to damage foreign relations. And the position of the other side, Justice Breyer, by the way, is that rape can never be punished in the military."

So those are all textual, contextual clues, and, of course, also the fact that Article 55 separately deals with limits on what punishment may be imposed. So it would be very odd for Congress to have obliquely imported it in Article 43 when they have a separate article of the code that -- that deals with it.

It is true that they rarely impose it, but none of that matters to Congress's judgment that the offense is so serious that it should be prosecutable at any time.

Thus, after this Court held in Coker that the Eighth Amendment forecloses the death penalty for rape, every military court to reach the issue held that the same result applied automatically to courts-martial, including CAAF's predecessor in June 1986. When Congress eliminated a statute of limitations for any offense punishable by death just five months later, it was, therefore, clear that rape was not such an offense because the UCMJ itself foreclosed the death penalty. Indeed, that was still clear for over a decade after the 1986 amendment, as military courts repeatedly held that rape was subject to a five-year statute of limitations. And perhaps most importantly, that conclusion was still clear to Congress in 2003, when it provided that, where the victim was a minor, rape by a service member could be prosecuted until the victim's 25th birthday. If Congress believed that rape was punishable by death under the 1986 amendment, the 2003 reform was not just unnecessary, it would have shortened the statute of limitations. Congress finally eliminated a statute of limitations for all rape offenses in 2006 so that the military may today try any such offense committed since then."

We agree that this Court can and, therefore, should avoid the constitutional question by deferring to Congress's judgment in 1950 to protect service members from cruel and unusual punishment to the same extent as civilians and, in 1986, to only eliminate a statute of limitations for offenses for which Article 55 allows the death penalty."

But, Justice Thomas, more importantly, we have 70 years of unbroken jurisprudence by every military court to consider the question, starting with the Court of Military Appeals in Wappler in 1953, holding that that was Congress's intent.

Justice Alito, we would not suggest that case was settled by Coker, but where, as here, there is no charge under those provisions, where it's simply under Article 120, which I should say Congress has not -- never sort of reenacted with the death penalty after 1950, before the Respondents' offenses, we think Coker, through Article 55, covers the case."

When pressed, counsel went two places. The first was the canons, but, as I tried to explain, I don't think there's any grievous ambiguity when you take into account the text and the contextual clues that Respondents really haven't grappled with. And the canons, as I tried to say to Justice Kagan, point in -- in both directions. And the most powerful canon, I would say, is constitutional avoidance and not getting into these long-reserved and difficult Eighth Amendment questions. My second point is I don't think it would do any violence to military law to read the code that way."

But, if the Court looks at those cases, they don't have any meaningful analysis of the Eighth Amendment, and, in any event, they would just return us to the question of what the Eighth Amendment requires in the military setting. On that -- finally, on that question, Justice Alito, Respondents' counsel, I think, correctly acknowledged to you that to prevail, he needs the Court to endorse the proposition that the death penalty is never a constitutionally permissible punishment for -- for rape inside the military. In our view, that doesn't accord with the consistent congressional judgment."
