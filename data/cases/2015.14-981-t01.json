In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy what was called the \"demanding burden of strict scrutiny\" articulated in Grutter and Bakke. By establishing that she was considered for admission to UT under a system that discriminated against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed upon UT the burden of -- of proving, by evidence of record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the interest defined, taking into account reasonably available nonracial alternatives.",

What the -- what the Court said last time around is to satisfy the compelling-interest inquiry, the University has got to articulate a reasoned, principled explanation for its decision to consider the educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this Court has found to be constitutional and substantial. The University of Texas has met that standard, has articulated exactly the same educational benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of specificity that this Court held constituted a compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330. It's exactly the same. And the -- the principal argument that my friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in particular, the effort to find whether you call it qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the University specifically says that what it's trying to accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives among minority students.",
