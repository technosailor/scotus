And there's a hundred different requirements that are imposed on the regulated parties by the subchapter, which is the classic structure for a public rights regulatory regime, and that becomes unmistakable if you look at 1681s, which is the public enforcement provision of the statute, which equally gives the FTC the right to bring an action for any violation of a requirement of the subchapter, and they can even do that in front of the FTC itself, which, of course, is the hallmark of a public right."

She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete."

I think, as to the two hypotheticals you gave, the first hypothetical, the antitrust plaintiffs, there might not be a typicality problem there because any differences would be easily calculated, and the court could consider that at the outside -- outset of the case and determine whether there's a viable damages model to separate different individuals out just based on kind of a mechanical mathematical calculation. I think the second example that you gave, which kind of is a liability-type example, in actuality, a lot of courts don't allow product liability-type cases to proceed as a class because individualized damages tend to -- tend to make the named plaintiff not typical or run afoul of other Rule 23 considerations.

While I would agree and this Court has repeatedly said that there's overlap between typicality and predominance and commonality, here, it does seem that this problem fits best within the typicality bucket, and that's because typicality focuses on the named plaintiff and his claims, whereas the other requirements, commonality and predominance, focus on all the class's claims in a -- in a broader way. And getting to the second kind of point, I think that this is not a trial issue because this Court has repeatedly said that a plaintiff needs to demonstrate that he or she meets requirements of Rule 23, and this may have to be done by an evidentiary showing at the outset of a case."

More broadly, I would -- I would say that if you look at the mechanics of class certification and the requirement under Rule 23(c) that it be done as early as practicable, at this point, at the point of class certification, it is unlikely that anyone has any idea what the nature of the trial testimony will be.

In fact, when Congress passed PSLRA and determined that it would be best for the class to have the strongest claimant take the lead, there was no need to modify Rule 23 or in other -- or in any other fashion change the substantive law of class certification. We have had experiences, as Justice Breyer suggested, with antitrust cases, where somebody bought a thousand times as many widgets as someone else, and that does not alter whether the claims or defenses are the same as are being asserted by the rest of the class. There is no basis for distinguishing in the legal claims that are being asserted. There are questions, of course, about whether there can be common answers to the common questions, as this Court determined in Dukes versus Wal-Mart, or there can be questions as to predominance."

But, if a material risk is enough and the answer to the Chief Justice's hypo is that's right, everybody can bring actions for traffic violations that didn't actually realize themselves in any harm, I mean, the Article III courts could be open to all sorts of trivial injuries where everybody should be essentially toasting their good luck, not suing the person who posed a risk to them but didn't actually injure them. Another point on standing, I think it is worth recognizing why this issue is so important, is there are people in our system of government who do get to pursue violations of federal statutes without suffering injuries-in-fact."
