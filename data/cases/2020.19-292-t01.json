The court of appeals' decision conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the word \"seizure\" at the time of the Fourth Amendment's adoption, and it conflicts with this Court's precedent."

The Court explained in Atwater that an examination of the common law of arrest tells us what the founding generation would have understood to be an unreasonable seizure of a person."

Instead, the Court expressly framed the question presented as whether, with respect to a show of authority, as with respect to application of physical force, a seizure occurs even though the subject does not yield. The Court then has a long discussion of physical force seizure and specifically concludes that the application of restraining physical force, even if unsuccessful, can be a seizure. That language has never been abrogated, and that particular point was agreed to by the defense."

It's also true that, as I -- as I sort of alluded to before, for the last 30 years, Hodari D. has provided a clear and administrable standard to determine when these interactions between a police officer and a citizen rise to the level of the Fourth Amendment. And the United States' interest here is in establishing a clear and predictable rule that law enforcement can apply in the heat of the moment in the field, and we think the rule established in Hodari D. achieves those ends."

To start first with Justice Gorsuch's question about the Framers' textual choice, it -- it made sense for the Framers to use the word \"seizure\" because the word \"arrest\" covers only seizures of persons, and they needed language that would also encompass seizures of property. Their use of the word \"seizure\" to cover arrests was consistent with the founding era dictionaries and case law, which treated arrests and seizures of persons synonymously. As Ms. Taibleson said, we see that in Entick v. Carrington, where the Court repeatedly refers to the arrest of the plaintiff as a seizure, as did the underlying warrant at -- at issue."

The Court should reaffirm what it unanimously concluded in Hodari D. 30 years ago. At the founding, the Fourth Amendment prohibited the government from attempting to restrain private citizens with unreasonable physical force, regardless of submission, and it continues to provide that protection today.
