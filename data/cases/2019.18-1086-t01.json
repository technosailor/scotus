This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims."

Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense."

But -- and there's no reason to do it, because as the reasons thought in Cromwell in this Court in a very thoughtful opinion by Justice Field in 1877, you know, the Court took the time to -- to survey exhaustively all prior law of -- of -- of what we now call issue and claim preclusion. And while he talked about demand instead of claim, he -- he -- he juxtaposed in his opinion for the Court the two types of preclusion that we deal with today: The idea that once you have litigated a case, you can't -- you're foreclosed from raising defenses to undermine that case's resolution, but if it's something that you haven't litigated, that would not foreclose you in a subsequent case involving new claims."

One, they argued exactly the contrary, arguing that these were new acts, new claims, new circumstances in Marcel I, so if there is an estoppel here, it's judicial estoppel to them in changing their position now, having gotten to court and being here because of that. And then, second, Judge Leval's decision, not binding on this Court, but was clearly right because it stood for the unremarkable proposition that subsequent acts create new claims."
