And the language of the Twenty-First Amendment speaks directly to exactly what the purpose of this entire exercise was. The problem that the two federal statutes were designed to deal with was the fact that states had complete authority to say we're not going to allow any use or sale of alcohol within our states and had absolutely no authority to stop the import from other states of -- of alcohol. In the first instance, in the original package doctrine, they could sell it to retailers, and then, ultimately, beyond that, they could sell it directly to consumers."

And that predates all of these things. And nothing in the Wilson Act, nothing in the Webb-Kenyon Act, and certainly nothing in the Second Amendment -- Second -- or the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to overrule Walling. And, indeed, this Court said in Granholm, Granholm specifically, that that case and Scott -- and the third case whose name is going to escape me -- Tiernan, all three survived Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. So while it is true that they can -- they can -- they have virtual control -- virtually control -- virtual control is something else -- they have the ability to control the structure, that's simply a recognition of the three-tiered system. And just to go back to the history, what's the -- what's the purpose of the three-tiered system? It's to avoid the tied sales arrangement that gave rise to the prohibition in the first place. You want to have three distinct levels, you know, the -- the producers, the wholesalers, and the retailers."
