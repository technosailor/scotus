I think that if someone had done nothing wrong -- let us say that someone steals my car as I'm walking into a Target, commits a bank robbery, and the police seize that vehicle quite righteously, I mean, as a practical matter, of course, the police are going to return the vehicle to me. But, if the state were to go so far as to institute forfeiture proceedings against that person, as Justice Kennedy recognized in his Austin concurrence, there would be several serious constitutional problems with that. And it -- it may be that in those circumstances, where I'm entirely blameless, that the Court would hold that there is a substantive due process right to reject that forfeiture, or the Court would find it to be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the nonexistent defense. So I think Bennis can be easily reconciled with this case, particularly when -- when the Court looks at Justice Stevens' dissent in Bennis, which with two other Justices points out that Mrs. Bennis didn't bring an excessive fines defense."
