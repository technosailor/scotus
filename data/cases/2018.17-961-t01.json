And Congress had specifically considered the rule in Albrecht over the -- those three decades and it never acted on it. Yet, in 522 U.S. 3, State Oil versus Khan, the Court unanimously reversed Albrecht and came to the economically sound conclusion about the way to interpret restraint of trade. And we have courts here that are already importing a proportionality requirement into the reasonableness and fairness inquiries, and at no point do my friends indicate that Pearson versus NBTY, the Seventh Circuit decision, is wrong or why it's wrong or why it is not the superior rule here. And as we document in our opening brief, when courts demand that counsel is faithful to their fiduciary obligations, counsel responds to those incentives. The Ninth Circuit's rule creates incentives for class counsel to argue that it's too hard to get money to the class, and, in fact, the de minimis rule would take many settlements that are settling now for less than $1 per class member, for less than $2 per class member, that distribute tens of millions, even over $100 million to class members, it's now appropriate under the Ninth Circuit's rule to take all of that money and give it to the defendant's favorite charity or the plaintiff's favorite charity. If there are no further questions, I'd ask the Court to vacate and reverse."
