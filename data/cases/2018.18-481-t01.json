But then the Court immediately says that purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that has accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency's own conduct.

And in critical mass cases, when a party wants the release of some information that a party like us might say that's our confidential commercial information, more is required and you can be held to fail your Exemption 4 argument if you don't illustrate how you protect the information. So, for example, what is relevant and what was asked even in this very case, in -- in which these questions were presented to the trial court, do you bind it with nondisclosure agreements? Do you have security in place so that it limits the number of people even internally who have access to it? How do you make sure that it is not supplied accidentally in litigation, for example? How, in other words, do you make sure that it doesn't become public? Have you made sure that comparable information has not been made public in other forums? And so there are critical mass cases, decisions from the D.C. Circuit courts and from the Tenth Circuit courts that apply that, that look to those exact types of questions and say: Well, we can find something rather like this in publicly available information already."
