So if I could then turn to the -- to the bright-line criminal rule that I understand to be the core of Petitioner's case, in McNeely, this Court said that a State may condition driving on public roads and may require as a condition that a motorist arrested or detained for drunk driving agree to a BAC testing and that the State may impose significant consequences on the subsequent refusal.
