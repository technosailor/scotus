A locomotive, even dead, has important hydraulic, electrical, braking functions that it performs when moving from one place to another. A locomotive also can be redeployed for the purpose of satisfying the railroad's various logistical needs. So I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to answer the question by defining \"use\" so narrowly that you're taking away all the various purposes and services that a carrier can put to use for that particular locomotive would be to significantly diminish the force that Congress was intending to enact by protecting worker safety, because workers are on these locomotives whether they are still or in motion, whether they were powered on or powered off."

Now are there circumstances in which the storage might be so prolonged in which the railroad makes the locomotive functionally inoperable by locking the brakes or taking out all the fluids or decompressing all of the electrical devices and that sort of thing?

And that's why that kind of standard is one that basically comports also with the regulations because the regulations for periodic inspection require that the -- the locomotive be in a place where a worker could get underneath it.

And I think what also helps you is the point that most of the injuries on locomotives are when they're stationary, because otherwise we'd be gutting the statute. But the question then becomes, why take the SAA precedent, which helps you tremendously, and bring it into the LIA when, as a lot of the questions have illustrated, the LIA has a different focus? To me, that's -- it's a tough case for that reason, so if you can help me out."

Accordingly, as this Court has long recognized, once a carrier puts a rail vehicle into use, that rail vehicle remains in use until the carrier affirmatively withdraws it from active service for repair, storage, or retirement. This Court should reject Respondent's invitation to retreat from its precedents and preserve the full scope of the safety protections that Congress enacted."

So to take them where they're going to cause -- even if they do cause a potential problem, it's not going to have the massive consequences that it would have if it's in a railyard.

Right? And -- and that sort of common-sense factual insight, I -- I think, is the sort of judgment that Congress intended for courts to make under this statute. And Petitioner accuses us of adding words to the statute by suggesting that we want to draw a distinction between use as a locomotive and use as a vehicle. Again, I think that the safe harbor difference between the two statutes absolutely demands that you recognize that locomotives are sometimes in use as vehicles and sometimes in use as -- as locomotives.
