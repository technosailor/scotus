And so, when we ask could a reasonable jury have found use here, fair use here, we should be asking, could a reasonable jury applying an accurate version of the law have found fair use? And so we assume that the jury made the factual findings that are most favorable to Google, but then we ask: What is the right answer? Was this transformative? And I think that's the way that the Federal Circuit did it. The Federal Circuit said: We'll assume the version of the facts that is most in Google's favor, but then we will determine as a matter of law whether this is transformative.

The Federal Circuit made the point they deemed the jury verdict advisory and said, well, we'll take it from here."
