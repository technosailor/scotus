Here, the purpose inquiry actually narrows the scope of preemption because not only does the state have to use the authority that it does have to reach into and indirectly touch upon something that the federal government regulates, it has to do so for a very specific and impermissible purpose. And I think that if you adopted a contrary rule, unlike the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit, it really is a road map for completely undermining a multibillion-dollar industry. And that, Your Honor, is the reason I was citing Skull Valley, not because I believe that the holding obviously is binding on this Court, because its facts show that a state could simply shut down all nuclear activity by designating the roadway leading up to a nuclear plant as unsuitable for commercial trucking, even if the only commercial trucks that ever go up that roadway are to make deliveries to the facility."

And in the entire history of this Act, NRC has never once advanced the argument, as far as we're aware, that says because we can regulate milling, a fortiori we can regulate mining because mining is inextricably intertwined with milling. In fact, NRC has aggressively disclaimed that argument in a decision where a great deal actually turned on that argument. But the second question to raise, Justice Breyer -- to go back to Justice Breyer. So I think the first reason that Justice Breyer's example isn't covered by this situation is that we concede, once we're dealing with an NRC-regulated activity, a tailings facility, 2021(k) requires some sort of purpose analysis."

And we think the single clearest and completely dispositive decision by Congress in this case was the decision it made in 1946 that it reaffirmed in 1954 and has left undisturbed until the present day, that the federal government does not regulate uranium mining. For that reason, Virginia's inherent sovereign ability to control something as fundamental as what material gets pulled out of the ground remains fully intact, its ban should not be preempted, and this Court should affirm.
