Begin with the text of the statute. Congress drafted the appeal bar to apply to \"the determination whether to institute an inter partes review under this section.\" Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole.

So there are lots of different ways that someone who feels aggrieved by a misreading that cuts off power that otherwise exists, and I don't think that would also fall within the exception, just to make sure I'm rounding out the answer, for decisions that are committed to agency discretion, because, if the determination is we lack the authority to do something because they misread one of the outer limits on their power as opposed to we're declining to review, for reasons of agency resources or we just don't think this is important enough to spend our time on, that's a different type of question.
