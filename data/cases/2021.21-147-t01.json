Now, there, why is skepticism justified? It can't be because -- see, if it isn't a new factor, it falls within what has already been recognized as something that was -- Congress either wanted or at least permitted, et cetera. The reason I ask that is Justice Harlan's opinion in Bivens, which I think is interesting, traces Bivens the right for a court to have such a -- a rule way, way back, back to really the common law, back to England, back to -- and to John Marshall in -- in -- and -- and -- and so what's the reason -- and John -- John Marshall in Marbury versus Madison, you know, rights and remedies and so forth.

A federal law enforcement agent entered private property without a warrant and used excessive force, just like the federal agents in Bivens, as the Court's questions have indicated. The fact that the federal agent inquired about the visa status of Mr. Boule's guest in the process does not make this case any different from the other instances of law enforcement overreach in the search-and-seizure context in which this Court has long recognized that a Bivens remedy lies. And this case has none of the foreign policy or extraterritoriality concerns that animated the Court's decision in Hernandez. Instead, this is a case like the Court observed in -- in Abbasi, where Bivens has continuing force and even necessity. Mr. Boule's First Amendment claim addresses conduct that is similar to the conduct that this Court assumed in Hartman versus Moore could be remedied via Bivens, but even if it is a new context, there is no reason to withhold the remedy here. There's no national security considerations, no conceivable national security considerations with regard to the First Amendment claim, and no alternative administrative remedial scheme that exists. Awarding damages for federal officer -- individual damages for federal officer misconduct has long-standing roots dating back to the founding and remains appropriate, albeit more limited, today. And as the Court has observed on several occasions, Congress in the Westfall Act preserved the availability of individual damages for constitutional violations."

And that, to Justice Breyer's questions, the 83 agencies, the 5,500-mile land border with Canada, the idea that Bivens doesn't apply anywhere in that swath would sweep with far too broad a brush. Now I think it is possible -- and the Court's decision in Hernandez, of course, recognizes this -- that there are certain functions that may be performed by border patrol agents which may create a new context or may be a -- a reason counseling hesitation, but not every function performed by a border patrol agent falls into that category, and the conduct of Agent Egbert here certainly does not."

We are not talking about the boundaries of figuring out what did the Court mean in Abbasi by the context in which there would not be new extensions of Bivens. So I think a lot of that debate just depends on how, you know, what happens when you do have a Bivens extension."

As perhaps the Chief's most recent question indicates, I don't think it's -- it's right to think that Congress would be looking at the granular details of whether Agent Egbert should have stopped someone, you know, 50 meters from the Smuggler's Inn or at the Smuggler's Inn driveway or perhaps on the road up to the Smuggler's Inn. I think the question that this Court's cases have looked at, and Hernandez is a particularly good example, is what is the type of conduct that the officer is engaged in? It's not, you know, Agent Mesa and Hernandez engaged in a purportedly unjustified cross border killing of a teenager. It is situations where Border Patrol agents might be needing to use or use -- use -- use force, or here, situations in which Border Patrol agents are concededly performing immigration functions. I think that has to be right because if you were to allow a Bivens claim in this context, you would be having the prospect of liability hanging over officers' heads, and they need to know sort of not just, you know, if you visit the Smuggler's Inn you'll be -- you'll be subject to Bivens liability but, more broadly, if you are engaged in an immigration search and you have to use force, what are the contours of your liability going to look like? And then zooming out even further, courts have to ask, I think, under Abbasi and Hernandez, what are the costs of that going to be for the Border Patrol? What are the litigation costs? What are the systemic costs going to look like? What's a deterrent effect on top of all of the other remedies that are out there for dealing with this type of conduct, including the internal investigations Congress has mandated? So I think that really is the right level of generality."
