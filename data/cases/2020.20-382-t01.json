Then paragraph 2 makes it clear that those who settle their liability won't be subject to a contribution action from the matters addressed in the settlement. And then what does 113(f)(3)(B) add? Aren't judicially approved settlements already covered by the phrase \"following any civil action\" in paragraph 1?"

That necessarily implies that the decree does limit the United States' right to bring claims for related violations. There's also Justice Breyer's point that he raised in a question, which is the decree simply wouldn't make any sense if Guam didn't get anything out of it. Now they're relying on paragraph 48, but the first words of paragraph 48 are \"except as specifically provided herein.\" And as I just explained, the decree does specifically provide herein for the elimination of the United States' right to bring related claims."

The bottom line is that the United States wants to have its cake and eat it too. It sued Guam under the Clean Water Act in order to insulate itself from liability for its own role at the Ordot Dump, allegations that must be accepted as true, and now it wants to block Guam's actions to recover a portion of its cleanup costs by saying that the parties' settlement -- the Clean Water Act claims somehow barred a CERCLA contribution claim."
