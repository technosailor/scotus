If the government may not force motorists to display a motto, school children to say a pledge, or parades to include banners, Colorado may not force Ms. Smith to create and speak messages on pain of investigation, fine, and re-education. I welcome this Court's questions."

But, when you have an artist for hire and people come to them and say here's what I'd like you to make, there's a question about whether what they make is their statement or the customer's statement. So, if it was clear that it was not their statement, let's say the gay couple comes and they say we want \"God bless this union\" on our website, and the web designer says that's fine, but you understand under our name at the bottom we say on every website we believe that marriage is only between one man and one woman and we're going to put that on your website? Justice Alito says maybe that person will walk away, and maybe they will. But the point is, if they do that in every situation and it's clear that it's not their statement, then do we solve the -- the -- the difficult Justice Kagan problem of, like, who's -- who's making an expression here?"

So, you know, it -- what would you think of a holding that says that the First Amendment protects this designer's right to provide products that explicitly express her beliefs about marriage, so she absolutely has the right to say one man, one woman, in every website, and she has the right to refuse to say gay marriage is great in any website, but what she's really asking for in this case, I think, is the right to say the same thing, here's the wedding, it's at this place, et cetera, et cetera, but she's afraid that if she says it for gay people that that will be sort of like an implicit endorsement of their wedding, and so she wants to be able to protect against implicitly endorsing, right, in a way that we've never really recognized before in the same way, when it isn't really clear that that's her message, when we don't -- when an objective observer would know that she was really trying to do that?
