U.S. Postal Service told OSHA that this ETS's requirements are so burdensome for employers that the federal government is now seeking an exemption from its own mandate for the Postal Service. That's because OSHA's economy-wide mandate would cause permanent worker displacement rippling through our national economy, which is already experiencing labor shortages and fragile supply lines.

And then the problem with applying that here is, if you look at their own explanation for what the risk is -- this is at 61411 of the Federal Register -- they say the reason there's a risk in every workplace is you interact, you come into contact with people at the workplace. When you define the risk that broadly, that is not something that's arising out of the workplace."

To Justice Kagan's question about the who decides point, Congress tell -- told us who decides at 2112 -- 28 USC 2112 says that courts can issue stays, and the reason for that is they recognize that this was without notice and comment, and unless the courts could step in to abate illegal actions, nobody would be able to do so.

And what I took from Mr. Keller's answer, which seems to be right, is that the question is whether there is a grave danger for unvaccinated workers, period. What the Secretary said was \"employees who are unvaccinated are in grave danger from SARS COVID virus, but employees who are fully vaccinated are not.\" So the -- the purpose -- if this is to be sustained, it has to be on the ground that it presents a grave danger to unvaccinated workers who have chosen to be unvaccinated. That's my understanding of the issue, but maybe I haven't understood it correctly. Is that your understanding?

So it's never been the case that the Court has started at the outset by saying does this seem like a big deal, does this agency action have a lot of consequences, and then used that as a basis to depart from the plain language of the statute or to say Congress has to specifically authorize it; we're not going to give the statutory text its -- its ordinary meaning. Instead, in the cases where the Court has looked at those kinds of consequences, it has always identified a conflict with other express statutory language, a conflict with other statutes that Congress has enacted that directly addressed the issue at question, or a conflict with the entire structure of the statute such that it would be unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted it. And it's only been in those situations where the Court has identified a textual and structural problem with the agency's interpretation in the beginning, using those traditional tools of statutory construction, that the Court has then gone on to say that its interpretation of the statute is confirmed by the economic and political consequences that would ensue. So I think it would be a sea change for this Court to reverse the order of operations as the Applicants are asking for here and to start off by asking does this seem like it has economic and political consequences, and it would ultimately do a disservice to principles of the separation of powers and to -- to Congress's ability to have its clear statutory enactments, even if they're broad, given the effect that they have."

And it further explained why masking and testing would be essential if workers remain unvaccinated, in order to ensure that, despite their higher risk level of contracting the virus, they couldn't carry it into the workplace and spread it to their coworkers. So I think the suggestion that this wasn't adequately explained is inconsistent with the -- the arguments they're making. And as I understand their tailoring arguments -- and this actually touches on the question you asked earlier in the argument -- they're really focused on two things, the categories of workers and the -- the particular workplaces."

So whether we're talking about the agency's failure to explain, whether we're talking about the statutory term \"necessary,\" whether we're talking about how this has to be tethered to the workplace under the major questions doctrine, under any one of those theories, we are likely to succeed on the merits. And, finally, when it comes to the public interest, as this Court just recognized a few months ago, it is undisputable that the public has a strong interest in combatting the spread of the COVID-19 delta variant, but our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully, even in pursuit of desirable ends. We would respectfully request a stay of this unprecedented sweeping S -- ETS before Monday."
