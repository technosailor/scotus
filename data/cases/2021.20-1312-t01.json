Section 426 states that every individual who satisfies certain requirements shall be eligible -- or shall -- shall be entitled to Part A benefits, and that provision and others make clear that the entitlement is not absolute but subject to conditions, and it is not negated merely because Medicare does not pay for particular units of care. That is the best reading of the statute's text, context, and its population-focused design, and, at a minimum, a reasonable reading that deserves deference. The court of appeals and Respondent's contrary reading rests on two inferences based on other language concerning other programs. The court of appeals inferred from Congress's references to \"persons eligible for Medicaid\" that in the Medicare fraction Congress must have meant \"entitled to Part A\" to mean something different than it means throughout the statute. But Congress's use of \"entitled\" and \"eligible\" is fully explained by its usage of those terms in the underlying Medicare and Medicaid programs governed by separate statutory frameworks."

Well, no rational person would treat days as being entitled to benefits under Part A before the beneficiary had met the Medicare eligibility requirements. And, in fact, Your Honor, the same thing holds true for the Part B enrollment and the Part C enrollment and the Part D, right, where no one would allow a person that had not yet met the basic Medicare eligibility requirements to enroll in Part B. And yet \"for such days\" doesn't appear in any of those languages, and HHS isn't allowing folks to enroll in Part B before they've met the general Medicare eligibility requirements because it's obvious.

Got it. Your second argument, which you call your Encino argument, I think, I might think of it as a Chenery argument if -- if you want to put it in those terms, is, is the government now relying on different sets of arguments than were in the rulemaking and that -- that -- that should be taken into account before we grant it any kind of deference.

And fourth and finally, to the extent the Court is struggling to ascertain exactly what Congress is driving at in this very complicated statute, I think the answer is, regardless of whether there is any unambiguous answer, to go with the one that makes the most sense of the words Congress used and the overall -- overall architecture. Our approach does provide simplicity by saying you interpret who is entitled by looking at the provision that answers that question and says who is entitled, and you reject a reading that requires an exhausted patient not to be entitled because the statute says that. Our reading fits together at least better with the overwhelming majority of the Act's provisions and has a plausible straightforward theory of the congressional design that fits with a population focus."
