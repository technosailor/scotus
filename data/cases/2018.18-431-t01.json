And I'd also note the Sentencing Commission read the language in a circumstance-specific way from 1987 to 1989. After a few fits and starts, we settled into the categorical approach because that's where courts seemed to be going, particularly after the ACCA's residual clause and the rest of the Armed Career Criminal Act were enacted, and because it appeared to be workable, it appeared to be constitutional. Now I know you didn't want me to reference this Court's decisions, but after Dimaya and Johnson, it's clear that it is neither workable nor constitutional, so we've gone back and taken a fresh look. And I think if you take a fresh look at the statute, you'll see that it's better read or at least reasonably read, as the canon of constitutional avoidance would demand, to have a circumstance-specific approach."

And I think what Respondents' approach here would do is essentially eradicate that judgment, whereas adopting our approach, the only defendants who are going to -- eradicate their judgment as to anyone who would have fallen under 924(c)(3)(B), and I don't think that's the right approach to take when 924(c)(3)(B) can at least plausibly be read to have a circumstance-specific approach. Whereas, under a circumstance-specific approach, the only defendants who are going to be able to obtain relief are the ones who actually committed their crimes nonviolently.

But what was present there is a clear indication from Congress that we were to look at fact-specific conduct using the language in which or using the language committed by. And it's important to note that one of the reasons this Court ruled the way it did in Nijhawan is because the provision right above it clearly called for a conduct-based approach and it had identical structure. If we were to apply that same reasoning to this case, it would require a categorical approach because drug-trafficking crime is categorical, conceded by the government, the elements clause is categorical, effectively conceded by the government. And why would Congress intend to treat subsection (B) any differently without clear intent based on the language it chose? Two other provisions that are also categorical in nature that apply to present offenses that are cited by the government, Section 929 and Section 931, one dealing with body armor in connection with a crime of violence, one dealing with the use of armor-piercing bullets. If the government is correct here today, those would be treated differently than 924(c), use of a gun."

And so it's for these reasons that we ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit and hold the 924(c) residual clause void for vagueness. Thank you very much."

One is I think my friend agreed in a number of points that our burden is simply to show that this is a plausible interpretation of the statute. Second, I think it's helpful in that respect to think about whether this particular self-contained provision, if it were to have come before the Court as the first time anyone was ever urging a categorical approach, and a criminal defendant were coming before this Court and saying, no, you should apply the rule of lenity for me because I want a circumstance-specific approach. I understand that an ordinary defendant who commits commercial sex trafficking with a minor does so by threatening the minor with force, but that's not the way my crime was committed, and I want to prove that to a jury. And I were arguing the other side, I were arguing for the government that that didn't matter, it just matters what an ordinary defendant does, you have no right to show the jury what you did. I don't think anyone would think that that was a slam dunk case for the government that the court should apply an ordinary case categorical approach. Third, I think that shows why the rule of lenity shouldn't have any application here because it cuts both directions."

If it was really a draw, and your brief sort of walks this line in saying there's no empirical evidence to support how large the difference is, but logically speaking, the use of a gun in the vast majority of cases -- I spot you that there's a few where this wouldn't happen -- is itself always going to provide a substantial risk of violence.

Those cases obviously get to the jury because the defendant can claim that the situation was so under control that there was actually no risk that there would be a use of force, and we might lose a lot of those cases.
