The most natural reading of that clause is that it reaches only uses of force that are intentionally or knowingly aimed at another person. The force clause, therefore, does not reach a person who uses force recklessly because such a person is indifferent as to whether the force used falls on another person or on no one at all. Such an interpretation not only is compelled by the text of the force clause but is supported by its broader context, namely, to define the phrase \"violent felony\" and to identify those repeat offenders who are likely to point a gun at someone in the future and thus warrant a minimum of 15 years in prison. Until recently, our interpretation was the uniform interpretation of the courts of appeals, which relied on the text of the force clause and this Court's decision in Leocal construing it."

But, in the wake of this Court's decision four years ago in Voisine, some courts of appeals, including the court below, reversed course and adopted a contrary interpretation. Those courts were mistaken. In Voisine, this Court was interpreting different statutory language in a wholly different context, and it expressly reserved the question presented here. The government advocates an interpretation of the force clause that is grossly overinclusive, sweeping in offenses such as reckless driving, and thereby dramatically expanding the scope of the Act. The text of the force clause does not support that interpretation, and it certainly does not unambiguously dictate it."

But, second, to go to the reference in Section 922(g)(9) to \"a victim,\" I don't think that the government can get very much purchase out of that, and, indeed, the government really doesn't try to rely on that, but I do think that some lower courts have been somewhat misled by it. And let me explain, if I can, why I think that reference isn't tantamount to the inclusion of a phrase like \"against the person of another.\" Section 922(g)(9) does not require the use of force against the victim."

But I would make one additional point that I have not made to date, and that is that even if you think that the \"against\" phrase doesn't do all of the work, I would submit that this Court's decisions, and particularly its decision in Begay, do the remainder of the work because they make clear that the relevant language must be understood in its statutory context, which is to provide a definition of the phrase \"violent felony.\" And where someone acts recklessly, even though the law obviously attributes to that person a substantial degree of moral culpability, that action simply doesn't fall within the ordinary meaning of \"violent felony.\" And the second point I would make, Justice Breyer, is that whatever you might think about sort of the fine gradations in particular hypotheticals, I would respectfully submit that it would be a lot harder to draw the line between recklessness and criminal negligence because negligence itself in the model penal code is defined as being a -- a -- a situation in which an actor should be aware of, once again, a substantial and unjustifiable risk. As the government recognizes in Footnote 5 of its brief, states often define criminal negligence in recklessness terms."

The second point I would make is, again, looking at state statutes, I really do think that once you start drawing the line between recklessness and negligence, that these are really fine distinctions that involve the degree of risk, the extent of awareness of risk. And, of course, our fundamental submission to the Court today is that if you agree, as I think one respectfully must, that this Court in Leocal indicated that negligent offenses are excluded, there's simply no way from this statutory language to treat reckless and negligent offenses differently."

By contrast, it is clear that under the different language at issue here, in the wake of this Court's decision in Leocal, negligent offenses would be excluded.

No matter who says it, as Justice Kagan pointed out, it's a natural way to refer to the object of the actus reus of the crime. Petitioner, nevertheless, insists that the word \"against\" indirectly cuts out reckless offenses on the theory that it necessarily imposes a targeting requirement. But, if that targeting theory were correct, then, as Justice Gorsuch pointed out, even offenses with a mens rea of knowledge and certainly offenses with a mens rea of extreme recklessness would be excluded, a result the Petitioner himself disavows. In this Court's decision in Voisine, background principles of criminal law as the default state of liability and common sense all group \"knowingly causing injury\" with \"recklessly causing injury,\" which, by definition, involve the knowing disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that an injury will occur. That very line is reflected in the felony assault offenses of approximately 30 states, the robbery offenses of approximately 11 states, and the murder offenses of approximately 36 states in 1986 the Petitioner's reading would apparently have excluded at least a form of and a very core form of."

It doesn't focus at all on the linguistic distinctions between the two statutes, and -- and I'll get to that in one second, why -- why those shouldn't matter, but the -- the reason we know that -- the reason Voisine doesn't focus on that is because Voisine accepted that even under the statute at issue in that case, that force against a victim was required.

The second thing that I would say is the Court never resolved whether the residual clause covers reckless offenses, and it -- it -- and so it -- it really mattered whether it did. I don't think that necessarily cuts in Petitioner's favor. But the third thing I would say is even if you thought it didn't, I think that actually makes our case stronger because, if we can't get in things like reckless murder under the residual clause, then Congress surely wanted to include them under the elements clause. As I was saying to Justice Thomas, the elements clause is more restricted in that it is directed at occasions where force is actually used, whereas the residual clause and ultimately to its doom was focused on possibilities and whether or not something might ultimately result in the use of force."

And the Court looked at what Congress was trying to do as a categorical matter, and just because that can happen once doesn't mean it's going to happen three times to someone such that they're classified under the ACCA. And if you look at the set of offenses that they would cut out, which are felony assault by injury, second degree murder, and common law robbery, which the Court described in Stokeling as the paradigmatic elements clause offense, I think it's quite clear that our reading is much better than theirs."

First of all, I -- I think the different contexts actually cut in our direction because, first of all, they removed the Second Amendment concerns that Justice Thomas voiced in his dissenting opinion in Voisine. And -- and, second -- the second point I would make is that, here, you require three serious felony offenses, whereas, there, a single misdemeanor crime would have sufficed. And as I was suggesting earlier, we're talking about cases where people have been charged with felony assault or -- or murder or robbery or a serious offense like that, and we're not simply talking about cases where one crime makes all the difference. And the third -- the third thing I would say is that, if you hold for Petitioner in this case, I think you're going to reintroduce the exact same anomaly that you avoided in Voisine. As we explain on page 36 of our brief, the similarly worded elements clause in 18 U.S.C. 16, which defines crime of violence, is incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act's definition of crime of domestic violence. And if these reckless crimes are excluded, then the 35 state misdemeanor assault offenses that the Court focused on in Voisine wouldn't qualify under the Immigration and Nationality Act either. And I think it would be quite surprising to Congress to find that a fairly subtle change of wording, one statute requiring that the crime be committed by a domestic relation and the other statute requiring that it be against the person of another, make that big a difference as to whether the scheme works as it was intended to."

In Castleman, this Court already held that the statute at issue here and the statute at issue in Voisine should be construed differently in light of their different contexts."

It's only been since the government -- the Court's decision in Voisine that the government has been pushing the envelope and trying to do under the force clause what it can no longer do under the residual clause now that it has been invalidated. As this Court has said time and again in its many ACCA cases, this is a recidivist statute that should be construed narrowly."

And, finally, this is the paradigmatic case for the rule of lenity which Justice Kavanaugh applies in the sentencing context no less than it does in the substantive criminal context. Where every court of appeals has construed a statute one way for more than a decade, a defendant should not be subjected to a 15-year mandatory minimum based on a decision involving a different statute that the government itself said should be interpreted differently. The court of appeals' interpretation rests entirely on an overreading of this Court's decision in Voisine and an underreading of this Court's decision in Leocal, and its judgment should be reversed."
