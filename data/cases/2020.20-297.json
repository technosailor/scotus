  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In February 2011, Sergio Ramirez went with his wife and father-in-law to purchase a car. When the dealership ran a joint credit check on Ramirez and his wife, it discovered that Ramirez was on a list maintained by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), of people with whom U.S. companies cannot do business (i.e. \u201ca terrorist list\u201d). Ramirez and his wife still bought a car that day, but they purchased it in her name only. TransUnion, the company that had prepared the report, eventually removed the OFAC alert from any future credit reports that might be requested by or for Ramirez.</p>\n<p>On behalf of himself and others similarly situated, Ramirez TransUnion in federal court, alleging that the company\u2019s actions violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The district court certified a class of everyone who, during a six-month period, had received a letter from TransUnion stating that their name was a \u201cpotential match\u201d for one on the OFAC list, although only a fraction of those class members had their credit reports sent to a third party.</p>\n<p>The jury awarded each class member nearly $1,000 for violations of the FCRA and over $6,000 in punitive damages, for a total verdict of over $60 million. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the statutory damages but reduced the punitive damages to approximately $32 million.</p>\n<p>TransUnion asked the Supreme Court to resolve two questions, of which the Court agreed to decide only the first.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does either Article III of the Constitution or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 permit a damages class action when the majority of the class did not suffer an injury comparable to that of the class representative?</p>\n",
